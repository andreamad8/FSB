Haha <|endoftext|> Actually, meatloaf is a traditional German dish.  Smoking it is fairly simple.  Once you fix it up, instead of baking, you put it in your smoker.  It has such good flavor that way. <|endoftext|> Really?? I actually did not know that. Well that sounds really interesting... Maybe I would like it better that way. I think it's just a texture thing for me.  Meat... in a loaf... *shiver* <|endoftext|> LOL.  Well the shape is merely the tradition.  It is typically shaped like a loaf of bread, but it doesn't have to be.  You can shape it any which way you choose.   <|endoftext|> I think I would shape it like a steak. Then maybe it wouldn't freak me out so much hahaha. So is there a German story behind meatloaf?",
                "Well, the American meatloaf stems its traditions from the German idea, but Americans mixed ground pork with cornmeal.  This started in Pennsylvania in Colonial times."
