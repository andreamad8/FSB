I know they made a film version of Call of the Wild in the nineties. Do you like historical fiction? <|endoftext|> Ah yes that is what I was thinking of, The Call of the Wild. I believe White Fang also got made into a movie. <|endoftext|> I think so too, but I never saw it. Do you want recommendations based off this genre? <|endoftext|> If you have a historical fiction recommendation that would be great, thank you.",

One of his best roles, i think, was in 21 Grams with Naomi Watts. Do any of those title interest you at all? <|endoftext|> I'd like to begin a live stream with my friends.
