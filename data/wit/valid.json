As its name implies the wedge plow used a simple wedged design, in later years made from reinforced iron or steel. The railroad snow plow itself was usually attached to the front of either a customized rail car of some type with a pilot house attached to the top for the spotting crew. One of the most common types of wedge plows were those built by the Russell Snow Plow Company, which began manufacturing the machines after World War I. Developed with a bit of versatility, Russells were equipped with wings attached to the outside of what was known as the tongue (the wedge device that actually plowed the snow clear of the track), which could be adjusted. All wedge plows could not propel themselves and required being pushed by a locomotive."

Straight blades can be used parallel to the front of the vehicle to push snow straight ahead or turned at an angle to move snow off to one side. Most straight blades can be adjusted to leave the snow piled either to the left or right of the vehicle. V-shaped blades push snow to both sides of the vehicle at once. Both straight and v-shaped blades can be used to back-drag snow. Back-dragging is lowering the blade to the desired level then backing up, pulling the snow flat. Some v-shaped blades can be turned inside out to create a scoop that can lift and move snow."

Even a little thing like mentally thinking to yourself to drop your shoulders has made such a difference and I would have never had figured it out on Youtube. Look at the resume of the pros that the golf club has, interview them for like 5 minutes, pick out the one you like and have them give you a critique and you can decide from there if that pro is for you.",
