        "meta": "Once upon a time, in a barn near a farm house, there lived a little white kitten named Cotton. Cotton lived high up in a nice warm place above the barn where all of the farmer's horses slept. But Cotton wasn't alone in her little home above the barn, oh no. She shared her hay bed with her mommy and 5 other sisters. All of her sisters were cute and fluffy, like Cotton. But she was the only white one in the bunch. The rest of her sisters were all orange with beautiful white tiger stripes like Cotton's mommy. Being different made Cotton quite sad. She often wished she looked like the rest of her family. So one day, when Cotton found a can of the old farmer's orange paint, she used it to paint herself like them. When her mommy and sisters found her they started laughing. \n\n\"What are you doing, Cotton?!\" \n\n\"I only wanted to be more like you\". \n\nCotton's mommy rubbed her face on Cotton's and said \"Oh Cotton, but your fur is so pretty and special, like you. We would never want you to be any other way\". And with that, Cotton's mommy picked her up and dropped her into a big bucket of water. When Cotton came out she was herself again. Her sisters licked her face until Cotton's fur was all all dry. \n\n\"Don't ever do that again, Cotton!\" they all cried. \"Next time you might mess up that pretty white fur of yours and we wouldn't want that!\" \n\nThen Cotton thought, \"I change my mind. I like being special\".",

The note was written in orange crayon on white paper. Asta could not read the note. Sharkie could not read the note. They took the note to Asta's papa. \"What does it say?\" they asked. \n\nAsta's papa read the note. He told Asta and Sharkie, \"This note is from a little girl. She wants to be your friend.

In her other hand, she holds a paper carrier bag. \n\nI know this lady. It is not her first visit. She is the boy's grandmother, and her daughter bought the house next door last October. \n\nHer daughter, Nicole, speaks fluent English. But she is now in Shanghai, and her parents are here with the little boy. Nicole has obviously told her mother that I am having heart surgery soon, so her mother has decided I need more nutrients. \n\nI know what is inside the bag--a thermos with hot soup and a stainless-steel container with rice, vegetables and either chicken, meat or shrimp, sometimes with a kind of pancake. This has become an almost-daily practice. \n\nCommunication between us is somewhat affected by the fact that she doesn't speak English and all I can say in Chinese is hello. Once, she brought an iPad as well as the food. She pointed to the screen, which displayed a message from her daughter telling me that her mother wanted to know if the food was all right and whether it was too salty. I am not used to iPads, so she indicated I should go with her to her house. Then, she handed the iPad to her husband and almost immediately I found myself looking at Nicole in Shanghai and discussing her mother's cooking and salt intake. Instantly, tears welled in my eyes. \n\n\"Your mother just can't be bringing me meals like this all the time,\" I insisted. \"I can hardly do dishes in return.\" \n\n\"Oh, no, Lucy.\" Nicole said. \"Mum doesn't like western food. Don't worry about it; she has to cook for the three of them anyway, and she wants to do it.\" \n\nThe doorbell keeps ringing and there is the familiar brown paper carrier bag, handed smilingly to me. \n\nI am now working on some more Chinese words--it's the least I can do after such display of kindness. \n\n\"Thank you\" is, of course, the first one.

        "meta": "(CNN) -- Dennis Farina, the dapper, mustachioed cop-turned-actor best known for his tough-as-nails work in such TV series as \"Law & Order,\" \"Crime Story,\" and \"Miami Vice,\" has died. He was 69. \n\n\"We are deeply saddened by the loss of a great actor and a wonderful man,\" said his publicist, Lori De Waal, in a statement Monday. \"Dennis Farina was always warmhearted and professional, with a great sense of humor and passion for his profession. He will be greatly missed by his family, friends and colleagues.\" \n\nFarina, who had a long career as a police officer in Chicago, got into acting through director Michael Mann, who used him as a consultant and cast him in his 1981 movie, \"Thief.\" That role led to others in such Mann-created shows as \"Miami Vice\" (in which Farina played a mobster) and \"Crime Story\" (in which he starred as Lt. Mike Torello). \n\nFarina also had roles, generally as either cops or gangsters, in a number of movies, including \"Midnight Run\" (1988), \"Get Shorty\" (1995), \"The Mod Squad\" (1999) and \"Snatch\" (2000). \n\nIn 2004, he joined the cast of the long-running \"Law & Order\" after Jerry Orbach's departure, playing Detective Joe Fontana, a role he reprised on the spinoff \"Trial by Jury.\" Fontana was known for flashy clothes and an expensive car, a distinct counterpoint to Orbach's rumpled Lennie Briscoe. \n\nFarina was on \"Law & Order\" for two years, partnered with Jesse L. Martin's Ed Green. Martin's character became a senior detective after Farina left the show. ",

The borough is separated from New Jersey by the Arthur Kill and the Kill Van Kull, and from the rest of New York by New York Bay. With a 2016 Census-estimated population of 476,015, Staten Island is the least populated of the boroughs but is the third-largest in area at . Staten Island is the only borough of New York with a non-Hispanic White majority. The borough is coextensive with Richmond County, and until 1975 was the Borough of Richmond. Its flag was later changed to reflect this. Staten Island has been sometimes called \"the forgotten borough\" by inhabitants who feel neglected by the city government. \n\nThe North Shore\u2014especially the neighborhoods of St. George, Tompkinsville, Clifton, and Stapleton\u2014is the most urban part of the island; it contains the designated St. George Historic District and the St. Paul's Avenue-Stapleton Heights Historic District, which feature large Victorian houses. The East Shore is home to the F.D.R. Boardwalk, the fourth-longest in the world. The South Shore, site of the 17th-century Dutch and French Huguenot settlement, developed rapidly beginning in the 1960s and 1970s and is now mostly suburban in character. The West Shore is the least populated and most industrial part of the island.",

Just then, thunder was all-around them. The moment he turned the flashlight on. The house lights went off. A second later, the kitchen windows were broken. Eppes and Danielle ran to their boys who were still sleeping in their bedroom. \n\n\"Get up, get up, R.J.! \" Eppes shouted, waving his flashlight. The sleepy boy moved to the edge of the bed. Eppes held out his arms and ordered his son to jump. He was too late. The roof was torn down. R.J. was buried ,under the pieces. \n\n\"I've lost him,\" Eppes thought. Quickly, he hurried to Joel to shield him. Glass, wood, and plaster ( ) hit them. Then something huge, heavy-maybe the washing machine-knocked into him. He hurt his arms, but he still held the flashlight in one hand. \n\nAfter a long period, the wind began to die down. Eppes found himself standing in the ruins of his home. Darkness lay all about him. Then he thought he saw a shape moving straight toward him. It was R.J., guided home by the light of his father's flashlight. \n\nAt the hospital later, R.J. described what had happened to him. \"I rushed out when the wall started moving I was scared. My mom and dad were gone. Pieces of glass hit my back, and something hit my neck really hard. \" \n\nR.J. had been raised up into the air by the wind and dropped back to the ground.

About 15 unmarked cars could be seen on the street, as well as a Montgomery County police vehicle. \n\nSupervisory Special Agent Philip Celestini, who was at the residence, declined to comment further on the search, citing the active investigation. \n\nAruban Solicitor General Taco Stein said earlier Friday that the suspect will appear in court Monday, where an investigating magistrate could order him held for at least eight more days, order him to remain on the island or release him outright due to a lack of evidence. \n\nGiordano was arrested by Aruban police on August 5, three days after Robyn Gardner was last seen near Baby Beach on the western tip of the Caribbean island. \n\nGiordano told authorities that he had been snorkeling with Gardner when he signaled to her to swim back, according to a statement. When he reached the beach, Gardner was nowhere to be found, Giordano allegedly said. \n\nThe area that Giordano led authorities to is a rocky, unsightly location that locals say is not a popular snorkeling spot. \n\nAlthough prosecutors have continued to identify the 50-year-old American man by his initials, GVG, they also released a photo of a man who appears to be Giordano. His attorney, Michael Lopez, also has said that his client is being held as a suspect in Gardner's death. Lopez has not returned telephone calls seeking comment. ",

In the wild, tea plants may be 30 feet tall. But a plant grown for market is pruned. Pruning keeps the plant only three or four feet tall. This is an easy height for tea picking. Only the two top leaves and bud of each new shoot are picked. So to make money, tea plantations must be huge. In general, there are two kinds of tea. Black tea and green tea. Black tea is fermented. In the process, the tea loses nearly all of its healthy qualities. Green tea is steamed right after the leaves are picked. Green tea _ its healthy qualities. For example, it may prevent heart disease. How did we get tea bag? The answer: by accident. Tea merchants used to send samples in tin boxes. This was costly. One merchant thought of a cheaper way. He sent samples in small silk bags. Customers would cut open the bag. They would brew the leaves as usual. One customer put the bag into a pot. Then he just poured hot water over it. And the tea bag was born. Shen Nong was the first to drink tea. (Shen was a Chinese emperor.) This was about 2737 B.C. Shen had bad digestion. So he drank several cups of hot water daily. One day something happened. Leaves from a wild tea tree fell into the hot water pot. The next cup was poured. The water was now colored. Shen sipped it. He liked it. He drank it all. Shen was proud of his new drink. He served it to his guests. Word spread. People thought this way. Tea is good enough for the Emperor. So it must be good enough for the people. Tea became the drink of China.",

        "meta": "Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- The German news outlet Der Spiegel has published photographs of what appear to be two U.S. soldiers in Afghanistan posing over the bodies of dead Afghans -- images which threaten to further complicate the American military effort there. \n\nTwo images show the soldiers kneeling by a bloody body sprawled over a patch of sand and grass. A third shows what appears to be two bodies propped up, back to back, against a post in front of a military vehicle. \n\nDer Spiegel identifies the soldiers as Spc. Jeremy Morlock and Pfc. Andrew Holmes, who are both facing charges relating to the wrongful deaths of Afghan civilians. \n\nSpecifically, Holmes is charged with the premeditated deaths of three civilians, possessing a dismembered human finger, wrongfully possessing photographs of human casualties, and smoking hashish. \n\nHe is also accused of conspiring with Morlock to shoot at a civilian and then toss a grenade so it would look like the soldiers were under attack. \n\nMorlock is charged with three counts of murder. He is accused of killing one Afghan civilian in January 2010 with a grenade and rifle; killing another in May 2010 in a similar manner; and shooting a third to death in February 2010. \n\nU.S. military rules also prohibit \"taking or retaining individual souvenirs or trophies,\" which the photographs may be construed as. \n\nThe trial for the two soldiers is being conducted at Joint Base Lewis-McChord in Washington. Morlock's court martial is slated to begin Wednesday, while the start date for Holmes' court martial has not been publicly announced. ",

It was founded in 1967 as the Ohio College Library Center. OCLC and its member libraries cooperatively produce and maintain WorldCat, the largest online public access catalog (OPAC) in the world. OCLC is funded mainly by the fees that libraries have to pay for its services (around $200\u00a0million annually ). \n\nOCLC began in 1967, as the Ohio College Library Center, through a collaboration of Ohio university presidents, vice presidents, and library directors who wanted to create a cooperative, computerized network for Ohio libraries. The group first met on July 5, 1967 on the campus of the Ohio State University to sign the articles of incorporation for the nonprofit organization. The group hired Frederick G. Kilgour, a former Yale University medical school librarian, to design the shared cataloging system. Kilgour wished to merge the latest information storage and retrieval system of the time, the computer, with the oldest, the library. The plan was to merge the catalogs of Ohio libraries electronically through a computer network and database to streamline operations, control costs, and increase efficiency in library management. The goal of this network and database was to bring libraries together to cooperatively keep track of the world's information to best serve researchers and scholars. The first library to do online cataloging through OCLC was the Alden Library at Ohio University on August 26, 1971. This was the first occurrence of online cataloging by any library worldwide.",

After they had gone on, Mrs. Bussman said that the workman was closely like her husband and even suggested that he might be his brother. Franz laughed at the idea, pointing out that his brother had been killed in action during the war. Though Mrs. Busman knew this story quite well, she thought there was a chance in a million that she might be right. \n\nA few days later, she sent a boy to the workman to ask him if his name was Hans Bussman. Needless to say, the man's name was Hans Bussman. And he really was Franz's long-lost brother. \n\nWhen the brothers were reunited, Hans explained how it was that he was still alive. \n\nAfter having been wondered towards the end of the war, he had been sent to hospital and was separated from his unit . The hospital had been bombed and Hans had made his way back into Western Germany on foot. Meanwhile, his unit was lost and all records of him had been destroyed. Hans returned to his home, but the house had been bombed up. Guessing that his family had all been killed during an air-raid , Hans settled down in a village fifty miles away where he had remained ever since.",

For Harley and Villa Kennan were in no hurry. So long as the way was interesting, they dared not how long it proved from anywhere to anywhere. \n\nDuring this time Jerry learned a new name for himself--or, rather, an entire series of names for himself. This was because of an aversion on Harley Kennan's part against renaming a named thing. \n\n\"A name he must have had,\" he argued to Villa. \"Haggin must have named him before he sailed on the _Arangi_. Therefore, nameless he must be until we get back to Tulagi and find out his real name.\" \n\n\"What's in a name?\" Villa had begun to tease. \n\n\"Everything,\" her husband retorted. \"Think of yourself, shipwrecked, called by your rescuers 'Mrs. Riggs,' or 'Mademoiselle de Maupin,' or just plain 'Topsy.' And think of me being called 'Benedict Arnold,' or ' Judas,' or . . . or . . . 'Haman.' No, keep him nameless, until we find out his original name.\" \n\n\"Must call him something,\" she objected. \"Can't think of him without thinking something.\" \n\n\"Then call him many names, but never the same name twice. Call him 'Dog' to-day, and 'Mister Dog' to-morrow, and the next day something else.\" ",

        "meta": "Brownie and Spotty were neighbor dogs who met every day to play together. These two loved each other and played together so often that they had worn a path through the grass of the field between their respective houses. One evening, Brownie's family noticed that Brownie hadn't returned home. They went looking for him with no success and by the next week he was still missing. Curiously, Spotty showed up at Brownie's house alone. Barking, whining and generally pestering Brownie's human family. Busy with their own lives, they just ignored the nervous little neighbor dog. Continuously,Ted, Brownie's owner, was disturbed by the angry, determined little dog. Spotty followed Ted about, barking insistently, then rushing toward a nearby empty lot and back, as if to say, \"Follow me! It's urgent!\" Eventually, Ted followed Spotty to a deserted spot half a mile from the house. There Ted found his beloved Brownie alive, one of his hind legs crushed in a steel leghold trap. Horrified, Ted now wished he'd taken Spotty's earlier appeals seriously. Then Ted noticed something quite remarkable. Spotty had done more than simply led Brownie's human owner to his trapped friend. In a circle around the injured dog, Ted found an array of dog food and table scraps which were later identified as the remains of every meal Spotty had been fed that week! Spotty had been visiting Brownie regularly, in the hope of keeping his friend alive by sacrificing his own comfort. Spotty had evidently stayed with Brownie to protect him from hunger and other dangers, and keep his spirits up. Brownie's leg was treated by a veterinarian and he recovered. For many years thereafter, the two families watched the faithful friends chasing each other down that well worn path between their houses.",

The girl's dog was acting very interested in what was in the bushes up ahead. To both the girl and the dog's surprise, there was a small brown bear resting in the bushes. The bear was not surprised and did not seem at all interested in the girl and her dog. The bear looked up at the girl and it was almost as if he was smiling at her. He then rested his head on his bear paws and went back to sleep. The girl and the dog kept walking and finally made it out of the woods.

Williams of the Harris County Sheriff's Department. \n\nAn investigation found that Rick James Lohstroh, 41, was shot by his son, who was sitting in the back seat of the man's Toyota 4-Runner, said Sgt. Williams. The shooting took place outside the home of Lohstroh's ex-wife, where the boy lives with his mother and a 7-year-old brother. \n\n\"We're not certain of anything until we finish our investigation,\" Williams said. \"The information we have at this time is that the 10-year-old did fire the weapon.\" \n\nThe mother and the 7-year-old were inside the house when the shooting occurred, said Williams. \n\nWilliams said the gun belonged to the boy's mother. After firing shots through the back seat, the boy exited the back of the vehicle and continued to fire at the car. \n\nThe man died on the way to Memorial Herman Hospital. \n\nLohstroh was a doctor at the University of Texas Medical Branch. \n\nThe man and woman shared custody of the children. \n\nWilliams said the mother and the boy were still in the home talking to investigators Friday night. \n\nNeighbors described the family as being quiet and keeping to themselves. \n\nJustin Gray, 17, was walking in the neighborhood when he heard gunshots. \"We've had a suicide in this neighborhood once, but never anything like this,\" Gray said.",

They brought no sign from Baldassarre, and, in spite of special watch on the part of the Government, no revelation of the suspected conspiracy. But they brought other things which touched her closely, and bridged the phantom-crowded space of anxiety with active sympathy in immediate trial. They brought the spreading Plague and the Excommunication of Savonarola. \n\nBoth these events tended to arrest her incipient alienation from the Frate, and to rivet again her attachment to the man who had opened to her the new life of duty, and who seemed now to be worsted in the fight for principle against profligacy. For Romola could not carry from day to day into the abodes of pestilence and misery the sublime excitement of a gladness that, since such anguish existed, she too existed to make some of the anguish less bitter, without remembering that she owed this transcendent moral life to Fra Girolamo. She could not witness the silencing and excommunication of a man whose distinction from the great mass of the clergy lay, not in any heretical belief, not in his superstitions, but in the energy with which he sought to make the Christian life a reality, without feeling herself drawn strongly to his side. \n\nFar on in the hot days of June the Excommunication, for some weeks arrived from Rome, was solemnly published in the Duomo. Romola went to witness the scene, that the resistance it inspired might invigorate that sympathy with Savonarola which was one source of her strength. It was in memorable contrast with the scene she had been accustomed to witness there. ",

An ambulance was called, and Richardson was taken to a local hospital before being transferred to Hopital du Sacre-Coeur in Montreal. From there she was transferred to Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. \n\nFriends and colleagues were saddened by her death. \n\n\"Natasha was brilliant, beautiful, funny, talented beyond measure, as emotionally raw as she was razor sharp,\" said Jodie Foster, who worked with Richardson in \"Nell,\" in a statement. \"Tasha loved fiercely and that love continues in all of us who knew her.

It wasn't exactly the most efficient system. \n\nThen last year, during one of her browsing sessions, she read a blog post that gushed about a new website called Pinterest. The virtual pinboard, where users can pin and organize images onto individual \"boards,\" didn't pique Neroy's interest at first, but she quickly changed her mind. \n\n\"Someone described it as an online filing system, and I thought, 'That's exactly what I need,' \" she said. \n\nSoon Neroy was pinning away and, like many Pinterest users, got quickly hooked. She first started with a Halloween board where she pinned costume ideas. Next, Neroy created a shared color board for redecorating her daughter's bedroom that she and her husband could add to. \n\nPinterest also allows other users to follow each other's boards and \"re-pin\" another person's images. In no time Neroy was sharing other people's pins and following users with similar tastes. \n\n\"It's been really neat to see what other moms are pinning,\" she said. \"Some days you run out of ideas and you don't know what to do to fill the time before bedtime. I thought it was going to be just me organizing, but it's really a community sharing all these different ideas that I didn't even know existed.\" ",

A traitor had just come in and told them where Bruce had slept the night before. Reluctantly Archie unfastened the chain from the pole, and holding the end in his hand went round with Hector to the front of the pavilion. He was resolved that if under the dog's guidance the party came close up with Bruce, he would kill the dog and then try to escape by fleetness of foot, though of this, as there were so many mounted men in the party, he had but slight hope. Led by the peasant they proceeded to the hut, which was five miles away in the hills. On reaching it Hector at once became greatly excited. He sniffed here and there, eagerly hunted up and down the cottage, then made a circuit round it, and at last, with a loud deep bay he started off with his nose to the ground, pulling so hard at the chain that Archie had difficulty in keeping up with him. Pembroke and his knights rode a little behind, followed by their men-at-arms. \n\n\"I pray you, Sir Earl,\" Archie said, \"keep not too close to my traces, for the sound of the horse's hoofs and the jingling of the equipments make him all the more impatient to get forward, and even now it taxes all my strength to hold him in.\" ",

        "meta": "Asuncion, Paraguay (CNN) -- Paraguay installed new top military commanders, but President Fernando Lugo, who had ordered the change in leadership, was not present for the ceremony. \n\nLugo's absence Thursday morning attracted attention given his administration's silence on the sudden change in the leadership of the country's army, air force and navy. \n\nThe president's decision to replace the top brass came a day after he publicly dismissed rumors about a military coup. \n\nBrig. Gen. Bartolome Ramon Pineda Ortiz was named as the new army commander. Brig. Gen. Hugo Gilberto Aranda Chamorro and Rear Adm. Egberto Emerito Orie Benegas took over the top posts at the air force and navy, respectively. \n\nThe announcement came from the armed forces, not the president's office. \n\nCibar Benitez, commander of the armed forces, was the only top leader to retain his post. \n\nOther changes would be forthcoming in the lower ranks, said Benitez at the swearing-in ceremony, but he denied there was any truth to talk of a coup. \n\nParaguay's history is filled with unstable transitions of power since it emerged from dictatorship in 1989. Although there hasn't been a coup since that year, there were attempted coups in 1996 and 2000, and President Raul Cubas resigned amid controversy in 1999. \n\nThe military shakeup is the third since Lugo took office. The former Catholic bishop was elected to a five-year term last year. His victory brought an end to six decades of one-party rule in Paraguay, but the honeymoon did not last long. \n\nIn April, Lugo admitted that he fathered a child while he was still a priest and that he may have fathered more. The revelation, which came as a shock to most, hurt his political image. Calls for his resignation began, and have continued as Lugo has struggled to push reforms through a majority-opposition legislature. ",

It is landlocked and borders the counties of Dorset, Somerset, Hampshire, Gloucestershire, Oxfordshire and Berkshire.

Salisbury Plain is noted for being the location of the Stonehenge and Avebury stone circles and other ancient landmarks, and as a training area for the British Army. The city of Salisbury is notable for its mediaeval cathedral. Important country houses open to the public include Longleat, near Warminster, and the National Trust's Stourhead, near Mere. \n\nThe county, in the 9th century written as \"Wiltunscir\", later \"Wiltonshire\", is named after the former county town of Wilton. \n\nWiltshire is notable for its pre-Roman archaeology. The Mesolithic, Neolithic and Bronze Age people that occupied southern Britain built settlements on the hills and downland that cover Wiltshire. Stonehenge and Avebury are perhaps the most famous Neolithic sites in the UK. \n\nIn the 6th and 7th centuries Wiltshire was at the western edge of Saxon Britain, as Cranborne Chase and the Somerset Levels prevented the advance to the west. The Battle of Bedwyn was fought in 675 between Escuin, a West Saxon nobleman who had seized the throne of Queen Saxburga, and King Wulfhere of Mercia. In 878 the Danes invaded the county. Following the Norman Conquest, large areas of the country came into the possession of the crown and the church.",

PALGRAVE. \n\nWhen Anne Woodford began to wake from the constant thought of the grief and horror she had left at Portchester, and to feel more alive to her surroundings and less as if they were a kind of dream, in which she only mechanically took her part, one thing impressed itself on her gradually, and that was disappointment. If the previous shock had not blunted all her hopes and aspirations, perhaps she would have felt it sooner and more keenly; but she could not help realising that she had put herself into an inferior position whence there did not seem to be the promotion she had once anticipated. Her companion rockers were of an inferior grade to herself. Jane Humphreys was a harmless but silly girl, not much wiser, though less spoilt, than poor little Madam, and full of Cockney vulgarities. Education was unfashionable just then, and though Hester Bridgeman was bettor born and bred, being the daughter of an attorney in the city, she was not much better instructed, and had no pursuits except that of her own advantage. Pauline Dunord was by far the best of the three, but she seemed to live a life apart, taking very little interest in her companions or anything around her except her devotions and the bringing them over to her Church. The nursery was quite a separate establishment; there was no mingling with the guests of royalty, who were only seen in excited peeps from the window, or when solemnly introduced to the presence chamber to pay their respects to the Prince. As to books, the only secular one that Anne saw while at Whitehall was an odd volume of Parthenissa. The late King's summary of the Roman controversy was to be had in plenty, and nothing was more evident than that the only road to favour or promotion was in being thereby convinced. ",

That they had been so extravagant as to engage rooms at a regular boarding-house, where they were to spend their substance on three square meals each day, seemed like a reckless disregard of money; and the price which they were to pay for board was stated at various sums from five to ten dollars per week. But that was not the only bit of wonderful news. \n\nJimmy Sullivan stated--and he was supported by several others as the time wore on--that Johnny himself had told him that they were to start a regular theatre, and had already engaged a hall, which would be converted into a first-class place of amusement as soon as possible. This would have been regarded simply as a rumor started for the purpose of injuring the credit of these young gentlemen, had it not come so directly from one of the parties concerned, and must therefore be true.

When he was gone Zarah told the other dragons. They said that they would trade all their green treasure to Sean too so he could have a safe dragon bed in his cave.

Since his resignation, Benedict holds the title Pope Emeritus. \n\nOrdained as a priest in 1951 in his native Bavaria, Ratzinger established himself as a highly regarded university theologian by the late 1950s and was appointed a full professor in 1958. After a long career as an academic and professor of theology at several German universities, he was appointed Archbishop of Munich and Freising and Cardinal by Pope Paul VI in 1977, an unusual promotion for someone with little pastoral experience. In 1981, he was appointed Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, one of the most important dicasteries of the Roman Curia. From 2002 until his election as Pope, he was also Dean of the College of Cardinals. Prior to becoming Pope, he was \"a major figure on the Vatican stage for a quarter of a century\"; he had an influence \"second to none when it came to setting church priorities and directions\" as one of John Paul II's closest confidants.",

I pity him very much.\" \n\n\"I think we all pity him,\" answered Dave. \"Nobody can be responsible after his mind breaks down.\" \n\n\"I feel sorry for Nat Poole and his folks,\" said Laura. \"This will give them a great deal of trouble, not to mention the expense.\" \n\n\"If Wilbur Poole was anywhere around Rayville it might pay to start a hunt for him,\" suggested Roger. \n\n\"I don't think you'll find him anywhere around here,\" answered Mr. Basswood. \"But it won't hurt to take a look around, if you boys care to take a walk.\" \n\nBen's father went off to send his telegram to Aaron Poole, and all the boys set off on a hunt for the wild man. They covered the streets of the village and some of the roads on the outskirts, but without success. They met three people who had talked to the strange individual, and from what had passed Dave and his chums were sure that the man must have been Wilbur Poole. \n\n\"I guess we'll have to give it up,\" said Phil, when it was getting late. \"I'm tired out.

        "meta": "A thorough understanding of adolescence in society depends on information from various perspectives, including psychology, biology, history, sociology, education, and anthropology. Within all of these perspectives, adolescence is viewed as a transitional period between childhood and adulthood, whose cultural purpose is the preparation of children for adult roles. It is a period of multiple transitions involving education, training, employment and unemployment, as well as transitions from one living circumstance to another. \n\nPuberty occurs through a long process and begins with a surge in hormone production, which in turn causes a number of physical changes. It is the stage of life characterized by the appearance and development of secondary sex characteristics (for example, a deeper voice and larger adam's apple in boys, and development of breasts and more curved and prominent hips in girls) and a strong shift in hormonal balance towards an adult state. This is triggered by the pituitary gland, which secretes a surge of hormonal agents into the blood stream, initiating a chain reaction to occur. The male and female gonads are subsequently activated, which puts them into a state of rapid growth and development; the triggered gonads now commence the mass production of the necessary chemicals. The testes primarily release testosterone, and the ovaries predominantly dispense estrogen. The production of these hormones increases gradually until sexual maturation is met. Some boys may develop gynecomastia due to an imbalance of sex hormones, tissue responsiveness or obesity.",

ON A MOUNTAIN PATH \n\n\"Armed men, my lords!\" had been Fanfulla's cry. \"We are betrayed!\" \n\nThey looked at one another with stern eyes, and with that grimness that takes the place which fear would hold in meaner souls. \n\nThen Aquila rose slowly to his feet, and with him rose the others, looking to their weapons. He softly breathed a name--\"Masuccio Torri.\" \n\n\"Aye,\" cried Lodi bitterly, \"would that we had heeded your warning! Masuccio it will be, and at his heels his fifty mercenaries.\" \n\n\"Not less, I'll swear, by the sound of them,\" said Ferrabraccio. \"And we but six, without our harness.\" \n\n\"Seven,\" the Count laconically amended, resuming his hat and loosening his sword in its scabbard. \n\n\"Not so, my lord,\" exclaimed Lodi, laying a hand upon the Count's arm. \"You must not stay with us. You are our only hope--the only hope of Babbiano. If we are indeed betrayed--though by what infernal means I know not--and they have knowledge that six traitors met here to-night to conspire against the throne of Gian Maria, at least, I'll swear, it is not known that you were to have met us. His Highness may conjecture, but he cannot know for sure, and if you but escape, all may yet he well--saving with us, who matter not. Go, my lord! Remember your promise to seek at your cousin's hand the gonfalon, and may God and His blessed Saints prosper your Excellency.\" \n\nThe old man caught the young man's hand, and bending his head until his face was hidden in his long white hair, he imprinted a kiss of fealty upon it.

The work put a little warmth into them, and the white men, at least, had been conscious of a growing uneasiness about their comrades in the boat. The breeze had, however, freshened before they set it, and there were white caps on the water when the _Selache_ headed for the ice. It had somewhat changed its formation when they approached it, for big masses had become detached from it and were moving out into the open water, while the opening had become perceptibly narrower. The light was now fading rapidly, and Wyllard took the wheel when Dampier sent the man there forward. \n\n\"Get the cover off the second boat, and see everything clear for hoisting out,\" he said to him, and then called to Wyllard. \"We're close enough. You'd better heave her round.\" \n\nShe came round with a thrashing of canvas, stretched out seawards, and came back again with her deck sharply slanted and little puffs of bitter spray blowing over her weather rail, for there was no doubt that the breeze was freshening fast. Then Dampier sent a man up into the foremast shrouds, and looked at Wyllard afterwards. ",

Multimedia contrasts with media that use only rudimentary computer displays such as text-only or traditional forms of printed or hand-produced material. \n\nMultimedia can be recorded and played, displayed, interacted with or accessed by information content processing devices, such as computerized and electronic devices, but can also be part of a live performance. Multimedia devices are electronic media devices used to store and experience multimedia content. Multimedia is distinguished from mixed media in fine art; for example, by including audio it has a broader scope. The term \"rich media\" is synonymous with interactive multimedia. \n\nThe term \"multimedia\" was coined by singer and artist Bob Goldstein (later 'Bobb Goldsteinn') to promote the July 1966 opening of his \"LightWorks at L'Oursin\" show at Southampton, Long Island. Goldstein was perhaps aware of an American artist named Dick Higgins, who had two years previously discussed a new approach to art-making he called \"intermedia\". \n\nOn August 10, 1966, Richard Albarino of \"Variety\" borrowed the terminology, reporting: \"Brainchild of songscribe-comic Bob ('Washington Square') Goldstein, the 'Lightworks' is the latest \"multi-media\" music-cum-visuals to debut as discoth\u00e8que fare.\" Two years later, in 1968, the term \"multimedia\" was re-appropriated to describe the work of a political consultant, David Sawyer, the husband of Iris Sawyer\u2014one of Goldstein's producers at L'Oursin.",

What should he say; or should he say anything? \n\nHe did not want to appear anxious to \"make up\" with him, nor did he want to seem as if he bore malice toward him. If he only knew how George felt about it! \n\nAs it was, he wished he had stopped somewhere on the road. He had thought of stopping at the mill--why had he not? That would just have given George time to pass. \n\nBoth boys appeared to be riding as slowly as their horses would consent to go, and yet when they met, Harry had not half made up his mind what he would say, or how he should say it, or whether it would be better or not to say anything. \n\n\"Hello, George!\" said he, quite unpremeditatedly. \n\n\"Hello!\" said George, reining in his horse \"Where are you going?\" \n\n\"Going home,\" said Harry, also stopping in the road. \n\nThus the quarrel came to an end. \n\n\"So you've sold the telegraph?\" said George. \n\n\"Yes,\" said Harry. \"And I think we made a pretty good bargain.

        "meta": "A team of British surgeons has carried out Gaza's first organ transplants for a long-term plan to train local medical staff to perform the operations. \n\nTwo patients underwent kidney transplants at the Shifa, Gaza's biggest public hospital. The operations were conducted a fortnight ago by a volunteer medical team from the Royal Liverpool hospital. \n\nZiad Matouk, 42, was born with one kidney and was diagnosed with renal failure several years ago. Matouk, whose wife donated one of her kidneys, hopes to return to his job within six months. The couple had sought a transplant in Cairo, but were rejected as unsuitable at a state hospital and could not afford the fee at a private hospital. \"We were desperate,\" said Matouk. \n\nThe UK-Gaza link-up began about a year ago after Abdelkader Hammad, a doctor at the Royal Liverpool hospital, was contacted by an anaesthetist at the Shifa, who outlined the difficulties the Gaza hospital was facing with dialysis . The Shifa is forced to rely on generators because of power cuts; spare parts for its ageing dialysis machines have been difficult to import; and supplies of consumables are often scarce. After an exploratory trip last April, Hammad---whose family is Palestinian---and three colleagues from Liverpool arrived in Gaza via Egypt last month, bringing specialist equipment. Two patients were selected for surgery. The first, Mohammed Duhair, 42, received a kidney donated by his younger brother in a six-hour operation. Two days later, Matouk received a transplant after his wife, Nadia, 36, was found to be a good match. The surgeon was carried out by the British team, assisted by doctors and nurses from the Shifa. \"We are very satisfied with the results,\" said Sobbi Skaik, head of surgery at the Gaza hospital. \n\nSkaik hopes that Gaza medical teams will eventually carry out kidney transplants independently, and that other organ transplants may follow. The Shifa is working with the Gaza ministry of health on a plan to train its doctors, surgeons, nursing staff and laboratory technicians in transplant surgery at the Royal Liverpool. \"Funding is a problem,\" said Hammad. \"In the meantime we'll go back as volunteers to Gaza for the next couple of years to do more transplants.\" The Liverpool team's next visit is scheduled for May.",

It is an exciting story: Robinson Crusoe hated the comfortable life in his home town. So, he want to be a seaman and travelled around the world. But one day, a terrible thing happened. A great storm came and their boat crashed! No one was alive in this accident except Robinson. He was the luckiest man in the world--Because all his friends were dead but he was alive. However, at the same time he was the most _ man of all--He must face the fact .Alone on an island without food, water or gun!But, all roads lead to Rome!He just used his hands to work hard!Then, he made a cave, built a house, grew corn and kept goats. In the end, he could enjoy the life on the island. In his twenty-fourth year on the island, he saved a wild man, and gave him the name of \"Friday\". With Robinson's teaching, \"Friday\" became a good servant. Friday, they got a boat and escaped from the island. Surely, the writer of Robinson Crusoe is really a hero! It's too hard to describe Robinson with words. We could say that Robinson was very clever, and also he was brave,...Certainly, too many good words can describe him. But now, I think it isn't important. However, the most important thing is what we have learned from the story. That is, use our own hands to work hard with confidence!",

A dexterous twist, and it went flying out of reach across the dressing tent. \n\nThen, before Snipper could recover, he received a stinging slap full in the face that sent him staggering backward on the grass. \n\nA shout of approval went up. \n\n\u201cGood for Leo!\u201d \n\n\u201cThat\u2019s right, boy, stand up for your rights!\u201d \n\nThe shout brought Adam Lambert, the general manager, to the scene. \n\nNo sooner had he appeared than all the performers walked away.

The Discogs servers, currently hosted under the domain name discogs.com, are owned by Zink Media, Inc., and are located in Portland, Oregon, US. While the site lists releases in all genres and on all formats, it is especially known as the largest online database of electronic music releases, and of releases on vinyl media. Discogs currently contains over 8 million releases, by nearly 4.9 million artists, across over 1 million labels, contributed from nearly 346,000 contributor user accounts\u2014with these figures constantly growing as users continually add previously unlisted releases to the site over time. \n\nThe discogs.com domain name was registered on 30 August 2000, and Discogs itself was launched in November 2000 by programmer, DJ, and music fan Kevin Lewandowski originally as a database of electronic music. \n\nHe was inspired by the success of community-built sites such as Slashdot, eBay, and Open Directory Project, and decided to use this model for a music discography database. \n\nThe site's original goal was to build the most comprehensive database of electronic music, organized around the artists, labels, and releases available in that genre. In 2003 the Discogs system was completely rewritten, and in January 2004 it began to support other genres, starting with hip hop. Since then, it has expanded to include rock and jazz in January 2005 and funk/soul, Latin, and reggae in October of the same year. In January 2006 blues and non-music (e.g. comedy records, field recordings, interviews) were added. Classical music started being supported in June 2007, and in October 2007 the \"final genres were turned on\" \u2013 adding support for the Stage & Screen, Brass & Military, Children's, and Folk, World, & Country music genres, allowing capture of virtually every single type of audio recording that has ever been released.",

        "meta": "Zen () is a school of Mahayana Buddhism that originated in China during the Tang dynasty as Chan Buddhism. Zen school was strongly influenced by Taoism and developed as a distinct school of Chinese Buddhism. From China, Chan Buddhism spread south to Vietnam, northeast to Korea and east to Japan, where it became known as Japanese Zen. \n\nThe term Zen is derived from the Japanese pronunciation of the Middle Chinese word \u79aa (Chan) which traces its roots to the Indian practice of Dhyana (\"meditation\"). Zen emphasizes rigorous self-control, meditation-practice, insight into Buddha-nature, and the personal expression of this insight in daily life, especially for the benefit of others. As such, it de-emphasizes mere knowledge of sutras and doctrine and favors direct understanding through zazen and interaction with an accomplished teacher. \n\nThe teachings of Zen include various sources of Mahayana thought, especially Yogachara, the Tath\u0101gatagarbha s\u016btras and the Huayan school, with their emphasis on Buddha-nature, totality, and the Bodhisattva-ideal. The Praj\u00f1\u0101p\u0101ramit\u0101 literature and, to a lesser extent, Madhyamaka have also been influential in the shaping of the \"paradoxical language\" of the Zen-tradition. \n\nThe word \"Zen\" is derived from the Japanese pronunciation of the Middle Chinese word \u79aa () (pinyin: \"Ch\u00e1n\"), which in turn is derived from the Sanskrit word \"dhy\u0101na\" (\u0927\u094d\u092f\u093e\u0928 ), which can be approximately translated as \"absorption\" or \"meditative state\".",

THE ROMAN BARONS \n\nHaving driven Charles VIII out of Italy, it still remained for the allies to remove all traces of his passage from Naples and to restore the rule of the House of Aragon. In this they had the aid of Ferdinand and Isabella, who sent an army under the command of that distinguished soldier Gonzalo de Cordoba, known in his day as the Great Captain. \n\nHe landed in Calabria in the spring of 1496, and war broke out afresh through that already sorely devastated land. The Spaniards were joined by the allied forces of Venice and the Church under the condotta of the Marquis Gonzaga of Mantua, the leader of the Italians at Fornovo. \n\nLodovico had detached himself from the league, and again made terms with France for his own safety's sake. But his cousin, Giovanni Sforza, Tyrant of Pesaro--the husband of Lucrezia Borgia--continued in the pontifical army at the head of a condotta of 600 lances. Another command in the same ranks was one of 700 lances under the youthful Giuffredo Borgia, now Prince of Squillace and the husband of Do\u00f1a Sancia of Aragon, a lady of exceedingly loose morals, who had brought to Rome the habits acquired in the most licentious Court of that licentious age. \n\nThe French lost Naples even more easily than they had conquered it, and by July 7 Ferdinand II was able to reenter his capital and reascend his throne. D'Aubigny, the French general, withdrew to France, whilst Montpensier, the Viceroy, retired to Pozzuoli, where he died in the following year. ",

It's difficult to put a finger on what it is,\" she said in her first interview, given exclusively to CNN. \n\nLife at the house wasn't entirely normal -- the queen's estate was about a mile away, and the young Princes Andrew and Edward (Diana's future in-laws) frequently visited to swim in the pool. \n\nWhen the butler would ring the gong for dinner, the children would rush to the stairs, slide down the wooden banister and run into the dining room. \n\nDespite growing up in the shadows of royalty, Crane and Mary Clarke, Diana's nanny starting at age 9, describe an \"ordinary\" childhood for Diana, a tomboy who loved going outdoors, climbing trees and playing with animals.

        "meta": "(Entertainment Weekly) -- How are the elements of the charming, traditional romantic comedy \"The Proposal\" like the checklist of a charming, traditional bride? Let me count the ways ... \n\nRyan Reynolds wonders if marrying his boss, Sandra Bullock, is a good thing in \"The Proposal.\" \n\nSomething old: The story of a haughty woman and an exasperated man who hate each other -- until they realize they love each other -- is proudly square, in the tradition of rom-coms from the 1940s and '50s. Or is it straight out of Shakespeare's 1590s? \n\nSandra Bullock is the shrew, Margaret, a pitiless, high-powered New York book editor first seen multitasking in the midst of her aerobic workout (thus you know she needs to get ... loved). Ryan Reynolds is Andrew, her put-upon foil of an executive assistant, a younger man who accepts abuse as a media-industry hazing ritual. \n\nAnd there the two would remain, locked in mutual disdain, except for Margaret's fatal flaw -- she's Canadian. (So is \"X-Men's\" Wolverine; I thought our neighbors to the north were supposed to be nice.) \n\nMargaret, with her visa expired, faces deportation and makes the snap executive decision to marry Andrew in a green-card wedding. It's an offer the underling can't refuse if he wants to keep his job. (A sexual-harassment lawsuit would ruin the movie's mood.) \n\nOK, he says. But first comes a visit to the groom-to-be's family in Alaska. Amusing complications ensue. \n\nSomething new: The chemical energy between Bullock and Reynolds is fresh and irresistible. In her mid-40s, Bullock has finessed her dewy America's Sweetheart comedy skills to a mature, pearly texture; she's lovable both as an uptight careerist in a pencil skirt and stilettos, and as a lonely lady in a flapping plaid bathrobe.

        "meta": "Height above average terrain (HAAT) (or less popularly, EHAAT, Effective Height Above Average Terrain) is a measure of how high an antenna site is above the surrounding landscape. HAAT is used extensively in FM radio and television, as it is more important than effective radiated power (ERP) in determining the range of broadcasts (VHF and UHF in particular, as they are line of sight transmissions). For international coordination, it is officially measured in meters, even by the Federal Communications Commission in the United States, as Canada and Mexico have extensive border zones where stations can be received on either side of the international boundaries. Stations that want to increase above a certain HAAT must reduce their power accordingly, based on the maximum distance their station class is allowed to cover (see List of North American broadcast station classes for more information on this). \n\nThe FCC procedure to calculate HAAT is: from the proposed or actual antenna site, either 12 or 16 radials were drawn, and points at 2, 4, 6, 8, and radius along each radial were used. The entire radial graph could be rotated to achieve the best effect for the station. The altitude of the antenna site, minus the average altitude of all the specified points, is the HAAT. This can create some unusual cases, particularly in mountainous regions\u2014it is possible to have a negative number for HAAT (the transmitter would not be located underground, but rather in a valley, with hills on both sides taller than the transmitter itself, for example).",

Shalikar said the Israel Defense Forces \"never received any official statement from any source\" regarding injuries to Shakoura or his relatives. \n\n\"The IDF wishes to convey that missiles are being fired at Israeli civilians from terrorists, and it has no intention of harming civilians when it returns fire at terrorists,\" he said. \n\nPalestinian security and medical officials said one person died and several others were wounded in the airstrike, which they said struck a Hamas naval building in northern Gaza.

Or is it Ronaldo, the current Ballon d'Or holder and a man seemingly able to score goals at will, no matter what the competition? \n\nSports marketing research company Repucom examined 15 different markets, ranging from Spain to the U.S., and found that Portugal skipper Ronaldo is the better-known of the two: 92% know of him, while 87% have heard of Messi. \n\nThe figures also show that the same number of men know about Messi as women know about Ronaldo -- 91%. \n\nThey reveal that Ronaldo sells more effectively, with 86% of those questioned regarding the ex-Manchester United man as \"an influential brand spokesman.\" \n\n\"Cristiano Ronaldo dominates in terms of his overall marketability -- largely because of the consistently high levels of awareness people have of him around the world, whilst Messi has a greater proportion of people that do know of him saying they like him,\" said Repucom's global head of research Mike Wragg.

Its main subdivisions are social anthropology and cultural anthropology, which describes the workings of societies around the world, linguistic anthropology, which investigates the influence of language in social life, and biological or physical anthropology, which concerns long-term development of the human organism. Archaeology, which studies past human cultures through investigation of physical evidence, is thought of as a branch of anthropology in the United States, while in Europe, it is viewed as a discipline in its own right, or grouped under other related disciplines such as history. \n\nSimilar organizations in other countries followed: The American Anthropological Association in 1902, the Anthropological Society of Madrid (1865), the Anthropological Society of Vienna (1870), the Italian Society of Anthropology and Ethnology (1871), and many others subsequently. The majority of these were evolutionist. One notable exception was the Berlin Society of Anthropology (1869) founded by Rudolph Virchow, known for his vituperative attacks on the evolutionists.

Except in the river valleys, trees of any size are scarce on the prairie, but the slender trunks and leafless branches were closely massed and afforded a little shelter. Outside on the open waste, the cold was almost too severe to face, and George once or twice glanced anxiously across the snowy levels, looking for some sign of Edgar, who should have joined them with the team and sledge. It was, however, difficult to see far, because a gray dimness narrowed in the horizon. George stood, dressed in snow-flecked furs, in the center of a little clearing strewn with rows of fallen trunks from which he was hewing off the branches. The work was hard; his whole body strained with each stroke of the heavy ax, but it failed to keep him warm, and the wind was growing more bitter with the approach of night. \n\n\"I don't know what can be keeping West,\" he said after a while. \"We haven't seen the mail-carrier either, and he's two hours late; but he must have had a heavy trail all the way from the settlement. I expect he'll cut out our place and make straight for Grant's. We'll have snow before long.\" \n\nThere was an empty shack not far away where, by George's consent, the mail-carrier left letters when bad weather made it desirable to shorten his round. \n\nGrierson nodded as he glanced about. The stretch of desolate white prairie had contracted since he had last noticed it, the surrounding dimness was creeping nearer in, and the ranks of poplar trunks were losing their sharpness of form. Now that the men had ceased chopping, they could hear the eerie moaning of the wind and the sharp patter of icy snow-dust among the withered brush. ",

BRUCE AND THE WAR OF INDEPENDENCE. \n\nThe position towards France of Edward I. made it really more desirable for him that Scotland should be independent and friendly, than half subdued and hostile to his rule. While she was hostile, England, in attacking France, always left an enemy in her rear. But Edward supposed that by clemency to all the Scottish leaders except Wallace, by giving them great appointments and trusting them fully, and by calling them to his Parliament in London, he could combine England and Scotland in affectionate union. He repaired the ruins of war in Scotland; he began to study her laws and customs; he hastily ran up for her a new constitution, and appointed his nephew, John of Brittany, as governor. But he had overlooked two facts: the Scottish clergy, from the highest to the lowest, were irreconcilably opposed to union with England; and the greatest and most warlike of the Scottish nobles, if not patriotic, were fickle and insatiably ambitious. It is hard to reckon how often Robert Bruce had turned his coat, and how often the Bishop of St Andrews had taken the oath to Edward. Both men were in Edward's favour in June 1304, but in that month they made against him a treasonable secret covenant. Through 1305 Bruce prospered in Edward's service, on February 10, 1306, Edward was conferring on him a new favour, little guessing that Bruce, after some negotiation with his old rival, the Red Comyn, had slain him (an uncle of his was also butchered) before the high altar of the Church of the Franciscans in Dumfries. Apparently Bruce had tried to enlist Comyn in his conspiracy, and had found him recalcitrant, or feared that he would be treacherous (February 10, 1306). ",

Once I saw a pair of socks.\" \n\nLuna was very afraid of humans. Her grandmother and mother had warned her about them. She was told that some humans are mean and hurt hawks. Her feet were so cold that it was difficult to grip tree branches. She became brave. She flew to the farmhouse on the big hill. When she landed on the roof, she could not believe her eyes. She saw socks! In late autumn, Henrietta the human had put laundry outside to dry and she had forgotten to bring in one tiny pair of socks. The socks were hanging on the clothesline by two wooden pins. Luna used her powerful beak to break the pins. She put on the socks and then flew back to her home in the huge tree.

It was far more heartbreaking than I'd expected, one of the most difficult and painful times in my life. After he passed away I stayed alone in his apartment. There were so many things to deal with. It all seemed endless. I was lonely. I hated the silence of the apartment. \n\nBut one evening the silence was broken: I heard crying outside. I opened the door to find a little cat on the steps. He was thin and poor. He looked the way I felt. I brought him inside and gave him a can of fish. He ate it and then almost immediately fell sound asleep. \n\nThe next morning I checked with neighbors and learned that the cat had been abandoned by his owner who's moved out. So the little cat was there all alone, just like I was. As I walked back to the apartment, I tried to figure out what to do with him. Having something else to take care of seemed _ But as soon as I opened the apartment door he came running and jumped into my arms. It was clear from that moment that he had no intention of going anywhere. I started calling him Willis, in honor of my father's best friend. \n\nFrom then on, things grew easier. With Willis in my lap time seemed to pass much more quickly. When the time finally came for me to return home I had to decide what to do about Willis. There was absolutely no way I would leave without him. \n\nIt's now been five years since my father died. Over the years, several people have commented on how nice it was of me to rescue the cat. But I know that we rescued each other. I may have given him a home but he gave me something greater.",

The country is located at the crossroads of main European cultural and trade routes. It is bordered by Italy to the west, Austria to the north, Hungary to the northeast, Croatia to the south and southeast, and the Adriatic Sea to the southwest. It covers and has a population of 2.06 million. It is a parliamentary republic and a member of the United Nations, European Union, and NATO. The capital and largest city is Ljubljana. \n\nThe territory is mostly mountainous with a mainly continental climate, with the exception of the Slovene Littoral that has a sub-Mediterranean climate and the north-western area that has an Alpine climate. Additionally, the Dinaric Alps and the Pannonian Plain meet on the territory of Slovenia. The country, marked by a significant biological diversity, is one of the most water-rich in Europe, with a dense river network, a rich aquifer system, and significant karst underground watercourses. Over half of the territory is covered by forest. The human settlement of Slovenia is dispersed and uneven. \n\nSlovenia has historically been the crossroads of West Slavic, South Slavic, Germanic, Romance, and Hungarian languages and culture. Although the population is not homogeneous, the majority is Slovene. South Slavic language Slovene is the official language throughout the country. Slovenia is a largely secularized country, but its culture and identity have been significantly influenced by Catholicism as well as Lutheranism. The economy of Slovenia is small, open, and export-oriented and has been strongly influenced by international conditions. It has been severely hurt by the Eurozone crisis, started in the late 2000s. The main economic field is services, followed by industry and construction.",

More than modern independence was prepared for, though I should not have expected recalcitration in a young Lily; but I think there was more ruffling of temper and more reserve than I can quite understand.' \n\n'It has not been a success.

And to hear he is free -- just joyful, I can't describe it.\" \n\n\"All this is just so new,\" said Saunders, who lives in Redondo Beach, California. \"I did not have much time to talk with him. We just have a lot of things to do and I cannot talk anymore. We need a little time to evaluate all this.\" \n\nThe governor of Somalia's Mudug region, Ahmed Muse, told CNN that local elders negotiated Moore's release, adding that the journalist is \"physically and mentally\" worn out. \n\nMoore boarded a plane at an airport in Galkayo, in the north-central part of Somalia, Muse said. \n\nMuse would not say where the journalist is headed. \n\n\"I'm absolutely thrilled,\" said Michel Todd, who was Moore's web editor at Pacific Standard magazine. \"It's like seeing somebody come back from the dead. It's a marvelous resurrection.\" \n\nTodd said Moore was a weekly freelance columnist who wrote often about Somalia. He had been researching Somali pirates. \n\n\"As a news organization, we wanted to write about his capture,\" Todd said. \"But we had been encouraged by the FBI and State Department to (not) write about it because this would hurt his cause. They said, if you really care about the guy, that is not a good idea, raising his profile would make his release more difficult.\" ",

Marge believed that the people of Qarth would attack them if they knew they were there. Qarth used to be filled with factories when Jerry was born. By the time Jerry was a teenager, most of the factories had gone away and most of the people worked on special new machines. They ate food from the fields outside of town. Their favorite food to eat was a special kind of corn. They didn't eat meat because nobody raised any farm animals. One day when he was 11, Jerry asked his mother who his father had been. His father's name was George, and he was 2 years older than Marge. Marge looked sad and told Jerry that George had left after he was born because the people in the town didn't like him. This made Jerry very sad. He went off to his corner of the car and didn't talk to Marge again until she went to bed. After she fell asleep he wanted to go out and look for his father. He packed some food and left. When Marge woke up she was upset, but she thought she knew where he had gone.",

The extreme opposite of endemism is cosmopolitan distribution. An alternative term for a species that is endemic is precinctive, which applies to species (and subspecific categories) that are restricted to a defined geographical area. \n\nThe word \"endemic\" is from New Latin \"end\u0113micus\", from Greek \u03b5\u03bd\u03b4\u03ae\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2, \"end\u0113mos\", \"native\". \"End\u0113mos\" is formed of \"en\" meaning \"in\", and \"d\u0113mos\" meaning \"the people\". The term \"precinctive\" has been suggested by some scientists, and was first used in botany by MacCaughey in 1917. It is the equivalent of \"endemism\". \"Precinction\" was perhaps first used by Frank and McCoy. \"Precinctive\" seems to have been coined by David Sharp when describing the Hawaiian fauna in 1900: \"I use the word precinctive in the sense of 'confined to the area under discussion' ... 'precinctive forms' means those forms that are confined to the area specified.\" That definition excludes artificial confinement of examples by humans in far-off botanical gardens or zoological parks. \n\nPhysical, climatic, and biological factors can contribute to endemism. The orange-breasted sunbird is exclusively found in the fynbos vegetation zone of southwestern South Africa. The glacier bear is found only in limited places in Southeast Alaska. Political factors can play a part if a species is protected, or actively hunted, in one jurisdiction but not another.",

If you can't, don't feel too bad; neither could the middle school teacher in England who received this as homework. This is Netspeak: the language of computerized communication found on Internet or cell phones. To new comers, it can look like a completely foreign language. So, what is the translation of the sentence above? My summer holidays were a complete waste of time. Before, we used to go to New York to see my brother, his girlfriend, and their three screaming kids face to face. I love New York. It's great. School teachers and parents say this new form of writing is harming the English language. Increasing spelling and grammatical mistakes can be seen in students' writing. They fear the language could become corrupted . \"Everyone should just relax\", say linguists . They believe Netspeak is in fact more of a good thing. David Crystal, from the University of Wales, argues that Netspeak and Internet create a new language use and the almost lost art of diary writing, has been picked up again. Geoffrey Nurberg, from Stanford University, agrees. \"People get better at writing by writing,\" he says. \"kids who are now doing text messaging, e-mails, and instant messages will write at least as well as, and possibly better than their parents.\" Linguist James says, for centuries, it is believed without exception that young people are harming the language. And you can _ that when today's teenagers become tomorrow's parents. They too will think this way. James argues that languages do not and cannot become corrupted. They simply change to meet the new needs. However, Netspeakers do agree that it is important to teach young people how to speak and write standard English. Cynthia McVey says, \"I can understand Netspeak worries teachers and it's important that they get across to their pupils that text messaging is for fun, but learning to write proper English is a must for their future.\" Perhaps we should give teenagers a little more trust anyway. Erin, aged 12, says, \"I wouldn't use text language in my homework. Texting is just for fun. \"",

Both he and Amabel sat for some time with Philip, and when she went away to write her letters, Philip began discussing a plan which had occurred to him of offering himself as chief of the constabulary force in the county where Redclyffe was situated. It was an office which would suit him very well, and opened a new hope of his marriage, and he proceeded to reckon on Lord Thorndale's interest, counting up all the magistrates he knew, and talking them over with Guy, who, however, did not know enough of his own neighbourhood to be of much use; and when he came up-stairs a little after, said he was vexed at having been so stupid. He was afraid he had seemed unkind and indifferent. But the truth was that he was so heavy and drowsy, that he had actually fallen twice into a doze while Philip was talking. \n\n'Of course,' said Amy, 'gentle sleep will take her revenge at last for your calling her a popular delusion. Lie down, let her have her own way, and you will be good for something by and by.' \n\nHe took her advice, slept for a couple of hours, and awoke a good deal refreshed, so that though his head still ached, he was able to attend as usual to Philip in the evening.

Many bridges and tunnels link the Bronx to the island and borough of Manhattan to the west over and under the narrow Harlem River, as well as three longer bridges south over the East River to the borough of Queens. Of the five boroughs, the Bronx is the only one on the U.S. mainland and, with a land area of 42 square miles (109 km2) and a population of 1,438,159 in 2014, has the fourth largest land area, the fourth highest population, and the third-highest population density. \n\nThe Bronx is named after Jonas Bronck who created the first settlement as part of the New Netherland colony in 1639. The native Lenape were displaced after 1643 by settlers. In the 19th and 20th centuries, the Bronx received many immigrant groups as it was transformed into an urban community, first from various European countries (particularly Ireland, Germany and Italy) and later from the Caribbean region (particularly Puerto Rico, Jamaica and the Dominican Republic), as well as African American migrants from the American South. This cultural mix has made the Bronx a wellspring of both Latin music and hip hop.",

        "meta": "Time was running out, and Mark Dickinson wasn't sure whether he'd get to see his dying 2-year-old grandson one last time. A long line at Los Angeles International Airport's security checkpoint had kept him from getting to his gate on time. \n\nHis grandson Caden would be taken off life support in a matter of hours in Denver, Colorado, with or without his grandfather's presence, according to CNN affiliate KABC. \n\n\"I was kind of panicking because I was running late, and I really thought I wasn't going to make the flight,\" Dickinson told KABC. \n\nThat's when a pilot from Southwest Airlines stepped up and held the flight at the gate until Dickinson arrived. The pilot was standing by the air bridge waiting for him when Dickinson arrived in socks, so rushed that he just grabbed his shoes at security and ran through the terminal. \n\n\"I told him, 'Thank you so much. I can't tell you how much I appreciated that.' And he said, 'No problem. They can't leave without me anyway,'\"Dickinson told KABC. \n\nAuthorities say Dickinson's grandson, Caden Rodgers, suffered a head injury after his mother's boyfriend threw him across the room. The boyfriend reportedly told police he was drunk and high on marijuana at the time. The child later died and the boyfriend has been charged with first-degree murder, according to the Aurora Sentinel. \n\nThanks to the pilot, Dickinson made it to Colorado in time to say goodbye to his grandson. Most airlines would punish any staff member who holds up a flight, according to consumer advocate Christopher Elliott, who broke the story of the sympathetic pilot on his blog. However, a Southwest spokeswoman said the pilot's actions were praiseworthy. \n\n\"You can't hold a plane for every late customer, but I think we would all agree that these were extenuating circumstances and the pilot absolutely made the right decision,\" Southwest spokeswoman Marilee McInnis said. \"I don't think you could ask for a better example of great service for our customers.\"",

        "meta": "Richmond, Virginia (CNN) -- The Virginia governor's race, billed as the marquee battle of an otherwise anticlimactic 2013 election cycle, is shaping up to be a foregone conclusion. \n\nDemocrat Terry McAuliffe, the longtime political fixer and moneyman, hasn't trailed in a poll since May. Barring a political miracle, Republican Ken Cuccinelli will be delivering a concession speech on Tuesday evening in Richmond. \n\nIn recent cycles, the Virginia race has been a key off-year barometer of national political sentiment. Four years ago, Republican Bob McDonnell won in blowout fashion, a victory that presaged the following year's GOP midterm wave. In 2005, Democrat Tim Kaine captured the governor's mansion, tapping into anxiety about President George W. Bush's handling of the Iraq War and Hurricane Katrina. \n\nNot so this year. The McAuliffe-Cuccinelli race has been defined by small-bore issues and character attacks rather than sweeping national concerns. \n\nBut despite the lack of late fireworks, there are plenty of crucial insights to be gleaned from the Virginia campaign. \n\nHere's what you need to know about this year's most important race: \n\n1. The 2012 playbook is still potent for Democrats \n\nMcAuliffe isn't exactly squeaky-clean. A longtime wheeler-dealer who has been less than forthcoming with his tax returns, \"the Macker\" has a history of eyebrow-raising business ventures that make for dangerous campaign fodder. The opposition research book on the former Democratic National Committee chairman is as thick a Virginia live oak. \n\nBut Democrats have successfully turned the race into a referendum on Cuccinelli, defining him over the summer as a right-wing zealot. A Washington Post poll last week showed that two-thirds of McAuliffe supporters said they were voting against Cuccinelli, rather than for McAuliffe. ",

After leaving a boxing match with former Death Row Records CEO Suge Knight, the rapper and his bodyguards got into a scuffle with 21-year-old Crips gang member Orlando Anderson in the lobby of the MGM Grand casino. Carroll, who worked with the city's bike patrol unit, had also been watching the same Mike Tyson fight, but was unaware of the brawl taking place in the lobby. \n\nLater, a white Cadillac pulled up beside Knight and Shakur while they were stopped at a traffic light and one man began shooting out of the back window. Carroll was the first officer to respond to the grisly scene. \n\n\"I grab the car door and I'm trying to open it, but I can't get it open,\" he says. \"[Knight] keeps coming up on my back, so I'm pointing my gun at him. I'm pointing it at the car. I'm yelling, 'You guys lay down! And you, get the f**k away from me!' And every time I'd point the gun at him, he'd back off and even lift his hands up, like 'All right! All right!' So I'd go back to the car, and here he comes again. I'm like, 'F**ker, back off!' This guy is huge, and the whole time he's running around at the scene, he's gushing blood from his head. Gushing blood! I mean the guy had clearly been hit in the head, but he had all his faculties. I couldn't believe he was running around and doing what he was doing, yelling back and forth.\" ",

It was here Paul found his brother on the morning of his arrival in London. \n\nThey shook hands in silence; Paul did not wish to say anything for a moment. His brother's appearance had choked him. It was one o'clock, but he was still in his dressing-gown; with sunken, pale cheeks, save for one bright spot, and with faint, dark rims underneath his eyes. There were a pile of blue papers and some ominous-looking envelopes on the table before him, and Paul could not help noticing the intense pallor of the hand which rested upon them. \n\n\"I wish you would let a fellow know what time you were coming,\" Arthur said, rather peevishly, but with an attempt at a smile. \"I didn't expect you till evening, so I was having a shack before dressing. I was late last night!\" \n\nPaul banished his gravity, as far as possible, and stood with his hands in his pockets, leaning against the mantel-piece. He heartily disliked the part of mentor, and he did not wish to play it, unless he were obliged. \n\n\"It was beastly early to get up,\" he said, \"but the connection at Normanton is so much better. One has to wait two hours by the late train, and Normanton is such a hole.

        "meta": "Writing articles about films for The Front Page was my first proper job. Before then I had done bits of reviewing--novels for other newspapers, films for a magazine and anything I was asked to do for the radio. That was how I met Tom Seaton, the first arts editor of The Front Page, who had also written for television. He hired me, but Tom was not primarily a journalist, or he would certainly have been more careful in choosing his staff. \n\nAt first, his idea was that a team of critics should take care of the art forms that didn't require specialized knowledge: books, TV, theatre, film and radio. There would be a weekly lunch at which we would make our choices from the artistic material that Tom had decided we should cover, though there would also be guests to make the atmosphere sociable. \n\nIt all felt like a bit of dream at that time: a new newspaper and I was one of the team. It seemed so unlikely that a paper could be introduced into a crowded market. It seemed just as likely that a millionaire wanted to help me personally, and was pretending to employ me. Such was my lack of self-confidence. \n\nTom's original scheme for a team of critics for the arts never took off. It was a good idea, but we didn't get together as planned and so everything was done by phone. It turned out, too, that the general public out there preferred to associate a reviewer with a single subject area, and so I chose film. Without Tom's initial push, though, we would hardly have come up with the present arrangement, by which I write an extended weekly piece, usually on one film. \n\nThe space I am given allows me to broaden my argument--or forces me, in an uninteresting week, to make something out of nothing. But what is my role in the public arena? I assume that people choose what films to go to on the basis of the stars, the publicity or the director. So if a film review isn't really a consumer guide, what is it? I certainly don't feel I have a responsibility to be 'right' about a movie. Nor do I think there should be a certain number of 'great' and 'bad' films each year. All I have to do is put forward an argument. I'm not a judge, and nor would I want to be.",

        "meta": "(Financial Times) -- While most consumer goods companies are seeking opportunities in China, domestic condom maker Safedom is going in the opposite direction -- seeking European partners or acquisitions as part of a bid to go global. \n\nThe company, majority-owned by its founder, has grown rapidly in its short life. It will sell 200m condoms this year, all within China, and is targeting sales of 1bn next year; the same number that Durex, the world's biggest player, was producing in the country within three years. \n\nBrian Fu, chief executive, was in the UK last week \"meeting potential partners and acquisitions\". Funding for any deal will either come from existing shareholders, bank loans or possibly through an overseas stock market listing, he said. \n\nDespite the size of the market on its own doorstep -- and added attraction of a government-mandated one-child policy -- Safedom sees its future on the international stage. It reckons its virus-proof latex condoms will enable it to compete alongside the global players such as Durex, now part of Reckitt Benckiser, and Ansell of Australia. \n\nHowever, Mr Fu said that the strength of his company -- whose range includes Beautiful Girl, Take Me and Green Lemon -- was in manufacturing and technology, and going global required bringing in branding and marketing expertise. \n\nSales outlets and channels are also likely to vary from China, where half of all condoms are bought by women. \n\n\"We think we have good leading edge technology and a good management team. What we lack is the branding part: we are not well known,\" Mr Fu said. ",

Here he lay sick many days, for the sword cut in his thigh festered so badly that at one time his life was threatened by gangrene, but, in the end, his own strength and healthy constitution, helped with Martha's simples, cured him. So soon as he was strong again, accompanied by Martin, he travelled into Leyden, which now it was safe enough for him to visit, since the Spaniards were driven from the town. \n\nHow his young heart swelled as, still limping a little and somewhat pale from recent illness, he approached the well-known house in the Bree Straat, the home that sheltered his mother and his love. Presently he would see them again, for the news had been brought to him that Lysbeth was out of danger and Elsa must still be nursing her. \n\nLysbeth he found indeed, turned into an old woman by grief and sore sickness, but Elsa he did not find. She had vanished. On the previous night she had gone out to take the air, and returned no more. What had become of her none could say. All the town talked of it, and his mother was half-crazed with anxiety and fear, fear of the worst. ",

        "meta": "A One Day International (ODI) is a form of limited overs cricket, played between two teams with international status, in which each team faces a fixed number of overs, usually 50. The Cricket World Cup is played in this format. One Day International matches are also called Limited Overs Internationals (LOI), although this generic term may also refer to Twenty20 International matches. They are major matches and considered the highest standard of List A, limited overs competition. \n\nThe international one-day game is a late twentieth-century development. The first ODI was played on 5 January 1971 between Australia and England at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. When the first three days of the third Test were washed out officials decided to abandon the match and, instead, play a one-off one day game consisting of 40 eight-ball overs per side. Australia won the game by 5 wickets. ODIs were played in white kits with a red ball. \n\nIn the late 1970s, Kerry Packer established the rival World Series Cricket competition, and it introduced many of the features of One Day International cricket that are now commonplace, including coloured uniforms, matches played at night under floodlights with a white ball and dark sight screens, and, for television broadcasts, multiple camera angles, effects microphones to capture sounds from the players on the pitch, and on-screen graphics. The first of the matches with coloured uniforms was the WSC Australians in wattle gold versus WSC West Indians in coral pink, played at VFL Park in Melbourne on 17 January 1979. This led not only to Kerry Packer's Channel 9 getting the TV rights to cricket in Australia but also led to players worldwide being paid to play, and becoming international professionals, no longer needing jobs outside cricket. Matches played with coloured kits and a white ball became more commonplace over time, and the use of white flannels and a red ball in ODIs was finally abandoned in 2001.",

THE SUPREME SACRIFICE \n\nTHROUGH the balance of the day and all during the long night Billy Byrne swung along his lonely way, retracing the familiar steps of the journey that had brought Barbara Harding and himself to the little island in the turbulent river. \n\nJust before dawn he came to the edge of the clearing behind the dwelling of the late Oda Yorimoto. Somewhere within the silent village he was sure that the two prisoners lay. \n\nDuring the long march he had thrashed over again and again all that the success of his rash venture would mean to him. Of all those who might conceivably stand between him and the woman he loved--the woman who had just acknowledged that she loved him--these two men were the most to be feared. \n\nBilly Byrne did not for a moment believe that Anthony Harding would look with favor upon the Grand Avenue mucker as a prospective son-in-law. And then there was Mallory! He was sure that Barbara had loved this man, and now should he be restored to her as from the grave there seemed little doubt but that the old love would be aroused in the girl's breast. The truth of the matter was that Billy Byrne could not conceive the truth of the testimony of his own ears--even now he scarce dared believe that the wonderful Miss Harding loved him--him, the despised mucker! \n\nBut the depth of the man's love for the girl, and the genuineness of his new-found character were proven beyond question by the relentless severity with which he put away every thought of himself and the consequences to him in the matter he had undertaken.

In 1956 Israel invaded the Egyptian Sinai, with one of its objectives being the reopening of the Straits of Tiran which Egypt had blocked to Israeli shipping since 1950. Israel was subsequently forced to withdraw, but won a guarantee that the Straits of Tiran would remain open. Whilst the United Nations Emergency Force was deployed along the border, there was no demilitarisation agreement. \n\nIn the period leading up to June 1967, tensions became dangerously heightened. Israel reiterated its post-1956 position that the closure of the straits of Tiran to its shipping would be a \"casus belli\" and in late May Nasser announced the straits would be closed to Israeli vessels. Egypt then mobilised its forces along its border with Israel, and on 5 June Israel launched what it claimed were a series of preemptive airstrikes against Egyptian airfields. Claims and counterclaims relating to this series of events are one of a number of controversies relating to the conflict.",

He started the job the next day. \n\nMeyer was lucky to work with a good boss--and _ .In nearly six years of driving for Kohner, Meyer became his right-hand man and learned a lot.By the 1970s, Meyer had built many relationships in the business.In 1975, the fate presented an opportunity and he started his own operation Creative Artists Agency, which became a huge success, representing Hollywood legends like Barbra Streisand, Tom Hanks and Tom Cruise. \n\nTwenty years later, Meyer was appointed to run Universal Studios, a position far beyond his youthful dream.But once he saw success was possible, he was driven to achieve it.Today, colleagues regularly owe his success--and theirs--to his humility and perseverance.It's a level of success that takes determination, personality and intelligence, whether it comes from a college education or from the street.",

The process and ceremonies of ordination vary by religion and denomination. One who is in preparation for, or who is undergoing the process of ordination is sometimes called an ordinand. The liturgy used at an ordination is sometimes referred to as an ordination. \n\nThe tradition of the ordained monastic community (\"sangha\") began with the Buddha, who established orders of monks and later of nuns. The procedure of ordination in Buddhism is laid down in the Vinaya and Patimokkha or Pratimoksha scriptures. There exist three intact ordination lineages nowadays in which one can receive an ordination according to the Buddha's teachings: \n\nSaicho repeatedly requested that the Japanese government allow the construction of a Mahayana ordination platform. Permission was granted in 822 CE, seven days after Saicho died. The platform was finished in 827 CE at Enryaku-ji temple on Mount Hiei, and was the first in Japan. Prior to this, those wishing to become monks/nuns were ordained using the Hinayana precepts, whereas after the Mahayana ordination platform, people were ordained with the Bodhisattva precepts as listed in the Brahma Net Sutra.",

In English the country was usually known simply as Germany. A national assembly was convened in Weimar, where a new constitution for the \"Deutsches Reich\" was written, and adopted on 11 August 1919. In its fourteen years, the Weimar Republic faced numerous problems, including hyperinflation, political extremism (with paramilitaries \u2013 both left- and right-wing), as well as contentious relationships with the victors of the First World War. The people of Germany blamed the Weimar Republic rather than their wartime leaders for the country's defeat and for the humiliating terms of the Treaty of Versailles. Weimar Germany fulfilled most of the requirements of the Treaty of Versailles although it never completely met its disarmament requirements, and eventually paid only a small portion of the war reparations (by twice restructuring its debt through the Dawes Plan and the Young Plan). Under the Locarno Treaties, Germany accepted the western borders of the republic, but continued to dispute the Eastern border.",

Much did she wish he could have such a friend as her brother would have been, and hope that nothing would prevent a friendship with her nephew. \n\nThe present question about the horse was, she thought, unfortunate, since, though Guy had exercised great self-denial, it was no wonder Philip was annoyed. Mr. Edmonstone's vexation was soon over. As soon as she had persuaded him that there had been no offence, he strove to say with a good grace, that it was very proper, and told Guy he would be a thorough book-worm and tremendous scholar, which Guy took as an excellent joke. \n\nPhilip had made up his mind to be forbearing, and to say no more about it. Laura thought this a pity, as they could thus never come to an understanding; but when she hinted it, he wore such a dignified air of not being offended, that she was much ashamed of having tried to direct one so much better able to judge. On his side Guy had no idea the trouble he had caused; so, after bestowing his thanks in a gay, off-hand way, which Philip thought the worst feature of the case, he did his best to bring Hecuba back into his mind, drive the hunters out of it, and appease the much-aggrieved William of Deloraine.

It is played indoors on a 68-yard field (about half the distance of an NFL field), resulting in a faster-paced and higher-scoring game. The sport was invented in the early 1980s and patented by Foster, a former executive of the United States Football League and the National Football League. \n\nFor its 2015 season, the league consisted of 12 teams, all from the United States; however, upon the completion of the regular season, the league announced that the two teams it had assumed operation of during the season would cease all operations effective immediately; a regular season game slated between the two had previously been canceled and declared a tie. Subsequently, one of the remaining teams, the Spokane Shock, severed its ties with the league to join the competing IFL. The AFL is divided into two conferences \u2013 the American Conference and National Conference. Starting 2016, each conference will have only four teams as the champion San Jose SaberCats announced in November 2015 that they were ceasing activity for \"reasons not associated with League operations.\"",

It includes 16 constituent states, covers an area of , and has a largely temperate seasonal climate. With about 82 million inhabitants, Germany is the most populous member state of the European Union. After the United States, it is the second most popular immigration destination in the world. Germany's capital and largest metropolis is Berlin, while its largest conurbation is the Ruhr, with its main centres of Dortmund and Essen. The country's other major cities are Hamburg, Munich, Cologne, Frankfurt, Stuttgart, D\u00fcsseldorf, Leipzig, Bremen, Dresden, Hannover and Nuremberg. \n\nVarious Germanic tribes have inhabited the northern parts of modern Germany since classical antiquity. A region named Germania was documented before 100\u00a0AD. During the Migration Period, the Germanic tribes expanded southward. Beginning in the 10th century, German territories formed a central part of the Holy Roman Empire. During the 16th century, northern German regions became the centre of the Protestant Reformation. After the collapse of the Holy Roman Empire, the German Confederation was formed in 1815. The German revolutions of 1848\u201349 resulted in the Frankfurt Parliament establishing major democratic rights. \n\nIn 1871, Germany became a nation state when most of the German states unified into the Prussian-dominated German Empire. After World War I and the German Revolution of 1918\u201319, the Empire was replaced by the parliamentary Weimar Republic. In 1933 the Nazi seizure of power quickly led to the establishment of Nazi Germany which was built upon a dictatorship and consequently led to World War II and the Holocaust. After the end of World War II in Europe and a period of Allied occupation, two German states were founded: the democratic West Germany and the socialist East Germany. Following the Revolutions of 1989 that ended communist rule in Central and Eastern Europe, the country was reunified on 3 October 1990.",

The only major change of provincial borders since that time has been the sub-division of the Canary Islands into two provinces rather than one. \n\nHistorically, the provinces served mainly as transmission belts for policies enacted in Madrid, as Spain was a highly centralised state for most of its history. The importance of the provinces has declined since the adoption of the system of autonomous communities in the period of the Spanish transition to democracy. They nevertheless remain electoral districts for national elections and as geographical references: for instance in postal addresses and telephone codes. \n\nA small town would normally be identified as being in, say, Valladolid province rather than the autonomous community of Castile and Le\u00f3n.

If he ejects, he is wise, but the plane crashes. If he stays in the plane, he risks his life. \n\nRecently, Chinese Air Force pilot Li Feng, 38, faced this choice during a training exercise. It was March 7 and he was flying a Jian-10 (Flghter-10) at 4,500 meters. A warning appeared on the plane's computer screen. He realized the plane might fail at any moment. \n\nLi Feng did a quick check of the engine and asked the base if he could return. When the fighter was 7km away from the airport, however, the engine stopped working. The plane began to fall at a speed of 25 meters a second from an altitude of 1,160 meters. \n\nUnder Air Force rules fighter pilots may eject if their aircraft loses engine power below 2,000 meters and can't be restarted. Before Li lost contact with the control tower, the commander in the air base asked him to eject. But Li Feng insisted on having another try. \n\n\"I knew where the deadline (to abandon the aircraft) was and was prepared for the ejection, but I decided not to give up unless the fighter was totally out of control,\" Li recalled during a recent television interview. \n\nAfter 104 seconds, Li was able to bring the fighter to a safe landing. The plane only suffered slight damage. \n\n\"You are a hero! Congratulations!\" Li's teacher, Xu yongling wrote in a text message to him after the landing. He said Li was a cool-headed pilot and very professional. \n\nLi's brave and calm act not only saved the 200 million yuan aircraft but also gave him invaluable first-hand experience of dealing with an engine emergency. \n\nFor his outstanding performance, the Air Force recently awarded him a gold medal.",

It is a giant planet with a mass one-thousandth that of the Sun, but two and a half times that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined. Jupiter and Saturn are gas giants; the other two giant planets, Uranus and Neptune are ice giants. Jupiter has been known to astronomers since antiquity. The Romans named it after their god Jupiter. When viewed from Earth, Jupiter can reach an apparent magnitude of \u22122.94, bright enough for its reflected light to cast shadows, and making it on average the third-brightest object in the night sky after the Moon and Venus. \n\nJupiter is primarily composed of hydrogen with a quarter of its mass being helium, though helium comprises only about a tenth of the number of molecules. It may also have a rocky core of heavier elements, but like the other giant planets, Jupiter lacks a well-defined solid surface. Because of its rapid rotation, the planet's shape is that of an oblate spheroid (it has a slight but noticeable bulge around the equator). The outer atmosphere is visibly segregated into several bands at different latitudes, resulting in turbulence and storms along their interacting boundaries. A prominent result is the Great Red Spot, a giant storm that is known to have existed since at least the 17th century when it was first seen by telescope. Surrounding Jupiter is a faint planetary ring system and a powerful magnetosphere. Jupiter has at least 69 moons, including the four large Galilean moons discovered by Galileo Galilei in 1610. Ganymede, the largest of these, has a diameter greater than that of the planet Mercury.",

        "meta": "(CNN) -- Major League Baseball on Monday suspended 13 players, including New York Yankees star Alex Rodriguez, after an investigation into the use of performance-enhancing drugs. \n\nThe league suspended Rodriguez for 211 regular-season games through the 2014 season, but the 38-year-old slugger said he planned to appeal. Twelve other players have accepted 50-game suspensions without pay. \n\nA-Rod and the other players are accused of having ties to the now-shuttered Biogenesis anti-aging clinic in south Florida and taking performance-enhancing drugs. Rodriguez has denied the accusation. \n\n\"I'm fighting for my life. I have to defend myself. If I don't defend myself, no one else will,\" he told reporters after the league announced its decision. \n\nTwitter reaction to A-Rod ban \n\nThe last seven months have been a \"nightmare,\" he said. \n\nIt \"has been probably the worst time of my life for sure,\" said Rodriguez, \"obviously for the circumstances that are at hand and also dealing with a very tough surgery and a rehab program, and being 38.\" \n\nAsked directly whether he had used performance-enhancing drugs, he declined -- repeatedly -- to comment. \n\n\"I think we'll have a forum to discuss all of that, and we'll talk about it then,\" Rodriguez said. \n\nEarlier in a written statement, he said that he was disappointed with the penalty and intends to appeal. He thanked family, friends and fans for their support and stressed that he was eager to get back on the field with his teammates. \n\nTimeline of Alex Rodriguez's rise and fall \n\nHis suspension is set to go into effect on Thursday, the league said. But officials also said that Rodriguez could keep playing if he appeals. ",

Sarah does not often like boys, but for a boy, Bill was alright. Most boys like Tom and Mark are stupid and a real pain, but Bill was a lot of fun to play with and didn't do dumb things like putting a booger on her back during recess. When Bill and Sarah arrived at the park, they first played ball in the grass near the playground. Then they chose to pretend that Bill was a monster and Sarah was the monster hunter. Sarah chased Bill all over the playground. They went in and out and up and down. Bill ran under the slide and stepped in a puddle. He didn't get hurt but he sure got plenty wet. Playing the monster game was the most fun that they had at the park that day. Later they sat in the grass for a picnic. They both took off their shoes so that Bill's feet could dry off and so that he wouldn't feel silly without shoes. Sarah took out her lunch and laid it out next to her. She had dried fruit and cheese and a peanut butter sandwich. Bill opened his lunch bag and found a coke, a bag of chips, and a ham salad sandwich. Sarah wanted to trade Bill his bag of chips for her fruit. He said that would be a fair trade and they enjoyed their lunch together. After they had their lunch, they lay back in the grass and watched the clouds. Some clouds looked like animals or shapes. Bill spotted one that looked like a reindeer. Sarah pointed to one that looked like a drum. Finally Bill and Sarah got up and brushed off the grass and headed for home.",

She will also sing with the 800-strong choir at the open-air Mass there. \n\nIn the pre-Mass program, Boyle plans to sing the hymn \"How Great Thou Art\" as well as her signature song, \"I Dreamed a Dream,\" the tune from the musical \"Les Miserables\" that shot her to fame in April 2009. \n\n\"To be able to sing for the pope is a great honor and something I've always dreamed of -- it's indescribable,\" Boyle, a Catholic, said in a statement. \"I think the 16th of September will stand out in my memory as something I've always wanted to do. I've always wanted to sing for His Holiness and I can't really put into words my happiness that this wish has come true at last.\" \n\nBoyle said her late mother was at the same Glasgow park when Pope John Paul II visited in 1982. \n\nAfter the final hymn at the end of the Mass, Boyle will sing a farewell song to the pope as he leaves to go to the airport for his flight to London, the church said.

At that moment he had but one desire--to kill his successful rival, Marcus. Marcus had escaped and returned to Rome; of that there could be no doubt. He, one of the wealthiest of its patricians, had furnished the vast sum which enabled old Nehushta to buy the coveted Pearl-Maiden in the slave-ring. Then his newly acquired property had been taken to this house, where he awaited her. This then was the end of their long rivalry; for this he, Caleb, had fought, toiled, schemed and suffered. Oh! rather than such a thing should be, in that dark hour of his soul, he would have seen her cast to the foul Domitian, for Domitian, at least, she would have hated, whereas Marcus, he knew, she loved. \n\nNow there remained nothing but revenge. Revenged he must be, but how? He might dog Marcus and murder him, only then his own life would be hazarded, since he knew well the fate that awaited the foreigner, and most of all the Jew, who dared to lift his hand against a Roman noble, and if he hired others to do the work they might bear evidence against him. Now Caleb did not wish to die; life seemed the only good that he had left. Also, while he lived he might still win Miriam--after his rival had ceased to live. Doubtless, then she would be sold with his other slaves, and he could buy her at the rate such tarnished goods command. No, he would do nothing to run himself into danger. He would wait, wait and watch his opportunity. ",

As the trip approached, I asked Marina if she was excited. Sure, Mom. shed say, shrugging. Marina was more excited about getting a tattoo on her ankle to represent my fight with ALS than trying on $ 10,000 wedding gowns. \n\nMy sister, Stephanie, had arranged for a car with a wheelchair lift to drive us from the hotel to Kleinfeld. The car driver wheeled me in. \n\nAt Kleinfeld with flower arrangements ten feet high, I felt like rolling into a dream. \"Wow!\" I said. I was wearing a new black outfit. Marina wore jean shorts, a sleeveless shirt, and sneakers. _ . The kind Kleinfeld ladies pointed out rooms like tour guides, naming the designers one by one on display: Alita Grham, Pnina Tornai... With Marina walking beside me, Stephanie pushed my chair up and down rows and rows of dresses that made Princess Diana's dress look modest. \n\nMarina didn't say a word. We turned a corner into the storage room, where hundreds of dresses hung in plastic protector sleeves. Marina and I were overwhelmed. \n\n\"Want to try one on ?\" I said, touching Marina's hand. \n\n\"OK,\" Marina said in her sharp, unsure voice. \n\n\"Tell them the style you'd like.\" \n\nMarina stood silent. I felt bad for bringing her, for forcing such an adult experience on a child. \n\nMarina picked an A-line dress. Or, more precisely, the ladies of Kleinfeld picked it for her. Marina was too shocked to do more than nod. As she took the gown into the dressing room, I tried not to think of my little girl on her wedding day or of her as a baby in my arms. I tried not to think of her with her own baby in her arms one day. \n\nI tried not to think of Marina right now, embarrassed by her mother's plans, by things she could not and should not yet understand. \n\nI am leaving money in my will for Marina's wedding dress. Stephanie has promised to bring her back to Kleinfeld to purchase it. \n\n\"No pure white!\" I said to Stephanie. \"Ivory. Not too much tulle . Think lace.\" \n\n\"Think royalty when picking a dress,\" I advised Steph as we waited outside the dressing room. \"Think Princes Kate. Elegant. Think long sleeves. They make dresses more formal.\" \n\nMarina came out, sleeveless, flared . She looked like a 14-year-old girl in the middle of a giant cupcake. \n\n\"I don't like the loose gown.\" she said. \n\nThat's my girl! \n\n\"How about trying on one with long sleeves?\" I asked her. \n\nThe ladies brought out a dress with long lace sleeves, an Empire collar, a ruched fitted waist, and a long, smooth silk skirt. \n\nMarina disappeared into the dressing room. When the door opened, she looked a foot taller and a decade older. I could clearly see the beautiful woman she will be one day. I simply stared. \n\nWhat do you do when you glimpse a moment you will not live to see? \n\nI dipped my head. Breathe, I told myself. I looked up. I smiled. Marina smiled back. \n\nI worked my tongue into position to speak. \"I like it,\" I said. \n\nIn that dress, Marina stood straight, shining brightly, and tall. \n\n\"You are beautiful,\" I whispered, my tongue barely cooperating. I don't know if she heard me. We took some photos. And moved on. A memory made.",

        "meta": "Parents might tell older children to \"Act your age\". But some researchers say that is what persons from thirteen to nineteen years old are doing. While teenagers can look all grown up, studies have shown that their brains are still developing. How much this explains their behavior, though, is a subject of debate. Jay Giedd of America's National Institutes of Health is a leader in this area of research. Doctor Giedd has been studying a group of young people since 1991. They visit him every two years for imaging tests of their brains. He says considerable development continues in young people from the teenage years into the twenties. A part of the brain called the dorsal-lateral prefrontal cortex appears especially undeveloped in teenagers. Researchers believe that this area controls judgment and consideration of risk. So, its underdevelopment may explain why young people seem more willing to take risks like driving too fast. Laurence Steinberg is a psychology professor at Temple University in Philadelphia. He says stronger laws and stronger parental control are needed to protect teens from themselves. That includes raising the age for driving. He says research shows that teenage brains are not fully equipped to control behavior. Other researchers, however, say there is not enough evidence to make a strong case for such findings. Psychologist Robert Epstein is a visiting scholar at the University of California in San Diego. Mr. Epstein notes that teen behavior differs from culture to culture. He says behavior depends for the most part on socialization. He believes that teenagers will demonstrate better, safer behavior if they spend more time with adults, and are treated more like them. But is that always true? Mike Males works at the Center on Juvenile and Criminal Justice in San Francisco. He suggests that all of this talk lately about brainless teens could be an attempt to take away attention from the reality. Writing in the New York Times, he says it is middle-aged adults whose behavior has worsened. In his words, if grown-ups really have superior brains, why don't we act as if we do?",

Wardman, the sheep manager, joined them at the corrals where several thousand young Shropshire rams had been assembled for inspection. \n\nThere was little need for conversation. Thayer was distinctly disappointed in this, for he felt that the purchase of ten carloads of such expensive creatures was momentous enough to merit much conversation. \n\n\"They speak for themselves,\" Dick had assured him, and turned aside to give data to Naismith for his impending article on Shropshires in California and the Northwest. \n\n\"I wouldn't advise you to bother to select them,\" Dick told Thayer ten minutes later. \"The average is all top. You could spend a week picking your ten carloads and have no higher grade than if you had taken the first to hand.\" \n\nThis cool assumption that the sale was already consummated so perturbed Thayer, that, along with the sure knowledge that he had never seen so high a quality of rams, he was nettled into changing his order to twenty carloads. \n\nAs he told Naismith, after they had regained the Big House and as they chalked their cues to finish the interrupted game: \n\n\"It's my first visit to Forrest's. He's a wizard. I've been buying in the East and importing. But those Shropshires won my judgment. You noticed I doubled my order. Those Idaho buyers will be wild for them. I only had buying orders straight for six carloads, and contingent on my judgment for two carloads more; but if every buyer doesn't double his order, straight and contingent, when he sees them rams, and if there isn't a stampede for what's left, I don't know sheep. They're the goods. If they don't jump up the sheep game of Idaho ... well, then Forrest's no breeder and I'm no buyer, that's all.\" ",

        "meta": "(CNN) -- According to the \"Guinness Book of World Records,\" Sherlock Holmes is the most popular role in the movies. \n\nSo if Robert Downey Jr. hardly seems like the iconic Sherlock (he's too short and muscular, and strains to suggest the intellectual arrogance that comes so easily to the English), he can take his place alongside such oddball castings as Buster Keaton, Charlton Heston and George C. Scott. And he's ideally suited to director Guy Ritchie's purpose, which is not to dust off your grandfather's Conan Doyle, but to juice today's kids with a quirky 19th century super sleuth. \n\nWhat's fun about these movies is that the equation works both ways. \n\nYes, this Holmes is more likely to get physical than his predecessors, he's even a bit of a boor, but he's still a more cerebral action hero than we find in most blockbusters, and the period trappings (a seamless blend of CGI and location work) help this franchise stand out from the crowd of comic book adaptations. \n\nRitchie and husband-and-wife screenwriters Kieran and Michele Mulroney (\"Paper Man\") map out a fast-moving -- if ridiculously digressive -- Victorian adventure that crisscrosses Europe by horseless carriage, train, boat, and, in Sherlock's case, pony. \n\nJust down the road from 221 Baker Street they're digging a tunnel for what will become the London Underground. The Industrial Age is beginning to stretch its muscles, while a series of terrorist atrocities are gnawing at the fragile understanding between the great European powers. Holmes detects something other than social unrest behind the bombings: an evil master plan leading inexorably to his nemesis, Professor Moriarty (Jared Harris). ",

But I know this was very late and I want to apologize for not saying it before. I didn't find the courage to do it at the beginning, and I know very well that made everything much more difficult.\" ",

It was one thing to have Roger missing, it was quite another to have his chum gone and have the berth made up as if it had never been occupied. \n\n\"He went to bed--I saw him go,\" muttered the boy from the country to himself. \"Am I dreaming, or what can the matter be?\" \n\nThe more Dave thought over the affair the more was he puzzled. As quickly as he could, he put on some of his clothing and slipped on his shoes. Then he opened the stateroom door and stepped out into the passageway leading to the main saloon. \n\nThere was a dim light burning outside, and nobody appeared to be in sight. Dave looked up and down the passageway eagerly, and even stepped to one of the corners. Then he walked to the main saloon, with its big sofas and easy-chairs, and its grand piano. Not a soul was in sight anywhere. \n\n\"Well, if this isn't the queerest yet,\" he murmured, and pinched himself, to make certain that he was not dreaming. He walked to one end of the saloon and then to the other, and then started for the stairs leading out on deck. \n\nAt that moment there came an extra-heavy gust of wind and the steamer rocked violently. Dave was thrown on his side and fell headlong over the end of a sofa. As he went down he heard several cries, one in a voice that sounded familiar to him. ",

Yet not all were there to ask God's rain for themselves. Old Charles Yuill was in his pew, after dreaming thrice that he would break up with the drought; and Bell Christison had come, though her man lay dead at home, and she thought it could matter no more to her how things went in the world. \n\nYou, who do not love that little congregation, would have said that they were waiting placidly. But probably so simple a woman as Meggy Rattray could have deceived you into believing that because her eyes were downcast she did not notice who put the three-penny- bit in the plate. A few men were unaware that the bell was working overtime, most of them farmers with their eyes on the windows, but all the women at least were wondering. They knew better, however, than to bring their thoughts to their faces, and none sought to catch another's eye. The men-folk looked heavily at their hats in the seats in front. Even when Hendry Munn, instead of marching to the pulpit with the big Bible in his hands, came as far as the plate and signed to Peter Tosh, elder, that he was wanted in the vestry, you could not have guessed how every woman there, except Bell Christison, wished she was Peter Tosh. Peter was so taken aback that he merely gaped at Hendry, until suddenly he knew that his five daughters were furious with him, when he dived for his hat and staggered to the vestry with his mouth open. His boots cheeped all the way, but no one looked up. ",

Mitzi Fierro told HLN's Nancy Grace that she hadn't been told whether any new charges will be filed against Hoskins. \n\n\"At this point they are returning him to the facility, and I believe that will be determined by the detectives who will investigate -- number one, his ability to walk away from the facility and, number two, if he violated anything from that point on,\" Fierro said. \n\nThe facility he was in is not secured, and it was unclear Friday whether Hoskins escaped or walked out on his own, investigators told CNN. \n\nHe was receiving treatment to get acclimated to society again and was supervised by a civilian staff and not officers, detectives said. \n\nBecause of the court order, Hoskins was deemed an \"escapee,\" detectives said. \n\nInvestigators had been looking for him in the Long Beach area because some of his arrest records come from that community, detectives said. \n\nPrior to his arrest Friday, Los Angeles police issued a warning to the public saying Hoskins \"is highly psychotic when not taking his medication and has very violent tendencies.\" ",

Two things surprise Valori: first, the great strength, impregnable as it were, to which Neisse has been brought since he saw it last,--superlative condition of that Fortress, and of the Army itself, as it gathers daily more and more about Frankenstein here:--and then secondly, and contrariwise, the strangely neglected posture of mountainous or Upper Silesia, given up to Pandours. Quite submerged, in a manner: Margraf Karl lies quiet among them at Jagerndorf, \"eating his magazine;\" General Hautcharmoi (Winterfeld's late chief in that Wurben affair), with his small Detachment, still hovers about in those Ratibor parts, \"with the Strong Towns to fall-back upon,\" or has in effect fallen back accordingly; and nothing done to coerce the Pandours at all. While Prince Karl and Weissenfels are daily coming on, in force 100,000, their intention certain; force, say, about 100,000 regular! Very singular to Valori. \n\n\"Sire, will not you dispute the Passes, then?\" asks Valori, amazed: \"Not defend your Mountain rampart, then?\" \"MON CHER; the Mountain rampart is three or four hundred miles long; there are twelve or twenty practicable roads through it. One is kept in darkness, too; endless Pandour doggery shutting out your daylight:--ill defending such a rampart,\" answers Friedrich. \"But how, then,\" persists Valori; \"but--?\" \"One day the King answered me,\" says Valori, \"'MON AMI, if you want to get the mouse, don't shut, the trap; leave the trap open (ON LAISSE LA SOURICIERE OUVERTE)!'\" Which was a beam of light to the inquiring thought of Valori, a military man of some intelligence.

Many of these technologies, such as the Media space, are not as widely used today as videoconferencing but were still an important area of research.

A surging mob of vacant and wondering peons, bearing a singular resemblance to the wild cattle and horses which intermingled with them in blind and unceasing movement across the Plaza and up the hilly street, and seemingly as incapable of self-government, were alternately dispersed and stampeded or allowed to gather again as occasion required. Some of these heterogeneous bands were afterwards found--the revolution accomplished--gazing stupidly on the sea, or ruminating in bovine wantonness on the glacis before the Presidio. \n\nEleanor Keene, who with her countrywomen had been hurried to the refuge of the Mission, was more disturbed and excited at the prospect of meeting Hurlstone again than by any terror of the insurrection. But Hurlstone was not there, and Father Esteban received her with a coldness she could not attribute entirely to her countrymen's supposed sympathy with the insurgents. When Richard Keene, who would not leave his sister until he had seen her safe under the Mission walls, ventured at her suggestion to ask after the American recluse, Father Esteban replied dryly that, being a Christian gentleman, Hurlstone was the only one who had the boldness to seek out the American filibuster Perkins, on his own ship, and remonstrate with him for his unholy crusade. For the old priest had already become aware of Hurlstone's blunder, and he hated Eleanor as the primary cause of the trouble. But for her, Diego would be still with him in this emergency. ",

Nominally a union of multiple equal national Soviet republics, its government and economy were highly centralized. The country was a one-party state, governed by the Communist Party with Moscow as its capital in its largest republic, the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic. The Russian nation had constitutionally equal status among the many nations of the union but exerted de facto dominance in various respects. Other major urban centres were Leningrad, Kiev, Minsk, Alma-Ata and Novosibirsk. The Soviet Union was one of the five recognized nuclear weapons states and possessed the largest stockpile of weapons of mass destruction. It was a founding permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, as well as a member of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), and the leading member of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (CMEA) and the Warsaw Pact. \n\nThe Soviet Union had its roots in the October Revolution of 1917, when the Bolsheviks, led by Vladimir Lenin, overthrew the Russian Provisional Government which had replaced Tsar Nicholas II during World War I. In 1922, the Soviet Union was formed with the unification of the Russian, Transcaucasian, Ukrainian, and Byelorussian republics. Following Lenin's death in 1924 and a brief power struggle, Joseph Stalin came to power in the mid-1920s. Stalin committed the state's ideology to Marxism\u2013Leninism (which he created), and initiated a centrally planned economy which led to a period of rapid industrialization and collectivization. During this period of totalitarian rule, Stalin imposed political paranoia; the mid-1930s Great Purge removed his opponents within and outside of the party via arbitrary arrests and persecutions of many people. Suppression of political critics, forced labor, and famines were perpetrated by Stalin; in 1933, a major famine struck Soviet Ukraine, causing the deaths of over 7 million people.",

Is it possible Disdain should die while she has such meet food to feed her?\" \n\n_Much Ado about Nothing._ \n\nThe Lyddell family did not continue in London much longer; it had been a short season, and though the session of Parliament was not over, most of the ladies were taking flight into the country, before the end of June,--Mrs. Lyddell among the rest,--and her husband went backwards and forwards to London, as occasion called him. \n\nThe girls were glad to get into the country, but Marian soon found that she had not escaped either from gaieties, or from the objects of her aversion; for Mr. Faulkner brought his mother and sisters to High Down House, gave numerous parties there, and made a constant interchange of civilities with the family at Oakworthy. Archery was pretty much the fashion with the young ladies that year; it was a sport which Marian liked particularly, having often practised it with Edmund and Agnes, and her bow and arrows were always the first to be ready. \n\nOne day when Marian, Caroline, and Clara were shooting on the lawn at Oakworthy, Mr. and Miss Faulkner rode from High Down, came out on the lawn, and joined them. From that moment, any one could see the change that came over Marian. Instead of laughing and talking, teaching Clara, and paying only half attention to her own shooting, she now went on as if it was her sole object, and as if she had no other purpose in life. She fixed her arrows and twanged her string with a rigidity as if the target had been a deadly enemy, or her whole fate was concentrated in hitting the bull's eye; and when her arrows went straight to the mark, or at least much straighter than those of any one else, she never turned her head, or vouchsafed more than the briefest answer to the exclamations around.

It is the most populous city in India with an estimated city population of 18.4\u00a0million. Along with the neighbouring regions of the Mumbai Metropolitan Region, it is second most populous metropolitan area in India, with a population of 21.3\u00a0million . Mumbai lies on the Konkan on the west coast of India and has a deep natural harbour. \n\nIn 2008, Mumbai was named an alpha world city. It is also the wealthiest city in India, Mumbai has the highest number of millionaires and billionaires among all cities in India. \n\nThe seven islands that came to constitute Mumbai were home to communities of fishing colonies of the Koli people. For centuries, the islands were under the control of successive indigenous empires before being ceded to the Portuguese Empire and subsequently to the East India Company when in 1661 Charles II of England married Catherine of Braganza and as part of her dowry Charles received the ports of Tangier and Seven Islands of Bombay. During the mid-18th century, Bombay was reshaped by the Hornby Vellard project, which undertook reclamation of the area between the seven islands from the sea. Along with construction of major roads and railways, the reclamation project, completed in 1845, transformed Bombay into a major seaport on the Arabian Sea. Bombay in the 19th century was characterised by economic and educational development. During the early 20th century it became a strong base for the Indian independence movement. Upon India's independence in 1947 the city was incorporated into Bombay State. In 1960, following the Samyukta Maharashtra Movement, a new state of Maharashtra was created with Bombay as the capital.",

Pies and patties, haunches of venison, trout and carp from the Rhine were placed on gold and silver dishes and adorned with tasteful ornaments of truly architectural beauty and monumental proportions. These were then handed over to the footmen, who, resplendent in gorgeous liveries of scarlet and azure, hurried along the marble passages carrying the masterpieces of culinary art to the banqueting-hall beyond, whilst the butlers, more sedate and dignified in sober garb of puce or brown, stalked along in stately repose bearing the huge tankards and crystal jugs. \n\nAll of the best that the fine old Ch\u00e2teau d'Aumont could provide was being requisitioned to-night, since M. le Duc and Mlle. Lydie, his daughter, were giving a farewell banquet to Charles Edward Stuart by the grace of God--if not by the will of the people--King of Great Britain and Ireland and all her dependencies beyond the seas. \n\nFor him speeches were made, toasts drunk and glasses raised; for him the ducal veneries had been ransacked, the ducal cellars shorn of their most ancient possessions; for him M. le Chef had raged and stormed for five hours, had expended the sweat of his brow and the intricacies of his brain; for him the scullions' backs had smarted, the wenches' cheeks had glowed, all to do honour to the only rightful King of England about to quit the hospitable land of France in order to conquer that island kingdom which his grandfather had lost.

There was a knock at the door, and Cynthia opened it to discover a colored hall-boy with a roll in his hand. \n\n\"Mistah Ephum Prescott?\" he said. \n\n\"Yes,\" answered Ephraim, \"that's me.\" \n\nCynthia shut the door and gave him the roll, but Ephraim took it as though he were afraid of its contents. \n\n\"Guess it's some of them war records from Amasy,\" he said. \n\n\"Oh, Cousin Eph,\" exclaimed Cynthia, excitedly, \"why don't you open it? If you don't I will.\" \n\n\"Guess you'd better, Cynthy,\" and he held it out to her with a trembling hand. \n\nCynthia did open it, and drew out a large document with seals and printing and signatures. \n\n\"Cousin Eph,\" she cried, holding it under his nose, \"Cousin Eph, you're postmaster of Brampton!\" \n\nEphraim looked at the paper, but his eyes swam, and he could only make out a dancing, bronze seal. \n\n\"I want to know!\" he exclaimed. \"Fetch Jethro.\" \n\nBut Cynthia had already flown on that errand. Curiously enough, she ran into Jethro in the hall immediately outside of Ephraim's door. Ephraim got to his feet; it was very difficult for him to realize that his troubles were ended, that he was to earn his living at last. He looked at Jethro, and his eyes filled with tears. \"I guess I can't thank you as I'd ought to, Jethro,\" he said, \"leastways, not now.\" ",

He later told CNN: \"I really didn't think it was going to end.\" \n\nIsner reflects on 'crazy' Wimbledon match \n\nThe match turned Isner into a household name in the sport, and after his straight sets defeat to Thiemo de Bakker in the second round the 25-year-old targeted a prolonged period of rest. \n\nBut on his return to the court he was made to work hard by Muller, saving two match points and firing 33 aces as he won in two-and-a-half hours to delight the 5,000 strong crowd. \n\n\"I didn't want to let [the fans] down,\" Isner told the ATP tour website. \"I didn't want to lose my first match here. Also, I had a lot of friends and family here, so I didn't want to go out early. \n\n\"I hadn't seen a live ball in quite some time and Gilles was never going to give me rhythm with his lefty serve. I felt I was shedding the rust off in the second and third sets. I will only keep getting better. ",

According to a census of 1 July 2012, by the Census Bureau, the city had a population of 130,741. \n\nIn 1637 a small party of Puritans reconnoitered the New Haven harbor area and wintered over. In April 1638, the main party of five hundred Puritans who left the Massachusetts Bay Colony under the leadership of the Reverend John Davenport and the London merchant Theophilus Eaton sailed into the harbor. These settlers were hoping to establish a (in their mind) better theological community, with the government more closely linked to the church than the one they left in Massachusetts and sought to take advantage of the excellent port capabilities of the harbor. The Quinnipiacs, who were under attack by neighboring Pequots, sold their land to the settlers in return for protection.",

Paul was so wonderfully happy in the thought that he was going back to Chicago, where, even though he could not see his parents, he should find relatives and friends, that he could talk of little else. Even the theatre was forgotten by him; for when Mopsey spoke of the necessity of getting another boy to take his place in the dramatic company he hardly gave the matter a thought, except to say that he hoped they would make plenty of money out of it. And Paul's partners were happy, more happy than they could possibly have been by any other outlay of their money; Paul's pleasure reflected on them to such a degree that they became almost as much excited as he was before the evening was over. \n\nGood Mrs. Green alternately laughed and cried, until she seemed to realize that such nervousness was not exactly suitable to the occasion, and then she busied herself by reading one of the papers Ben had brought home. \n\nMaster Treat had spent so much time on the good work he had carried through so successfully, and then had paid so much more attention to the boy he was going to surprise than to the sale of his goods, that, instead of helping Johnny as had been his purpose when he took some of his papers to sell, he was a drawback, and the consequence was that Mrs. Green had three evening papers to read, while Messrs. Jones and Treat had been \"stuck\" just that number. ",

There is also a site optimized for display on mobile devices, in both English and Spanish. In 2015, about 400 million people from around the world used MedlinePlus. The service is funded by the NLM and is free to users. \n\nMedlinePlus provides encyclopedic information on health and drug issues, and provides a directory of medical services. MedlinePlus Connect links patients or providers in electronic health record (EHR) systems to related MedlinePlus information on conditions or medications. \n\nPubMed Health is another NLM site that offers consumer health information, in addition to information for health professionals. \n\nThe National Library of Medicine has long provided programs and services for professional medical scientists and health care providers, including MEDLINE and the various services that access it, such as PubMed and Entrez. By the 1990s, more members of the general public were using these services as Internet access became widespread. But nonprofessional users could benefit from reliable health information in a layperson-accessible format. The National Library of Medicine introduced MedlinePlus in October 1998, to provide a non-commercial online service similar, for example, to the commercial WebMD. In 2010 another NCBI service, PubMed Health, complemented MedlinePlus in offering curated consumer health information; PubMed Health focuses especially on finding information about clinical effectiveness of treatments.",

        "meta": "Tom Brennan was working in a Philadelphia office building when he noticed a black bag. The bag contained a book. This chance discovery ended a 12-day search by the Library Company of Philadelphia for a historical treasure - a 120-page diary kept 190 years ago by Deborah Logan, \"a woman who knew everybody in her day,\" James Green, the librarian told the magazine American Libraries. Most of the diary is a record of big events in Philadelphia. It also includes a description of British soldiers burning Washington, D.C. in the war of 1812. She describes President James Madison on horseback as \"perfectly shaking with fear\" during the troubled days. George Washington, she writes, mistook her for the wife of a French man, and praised her excellent English. The adventure of the lost book began September 4 when Cory Luxmoore arrived from England to deliver the diary of his ancestor to the Library Company, which he and his wife considered to be the best home for the diary. Green told American Libraries he had the diary in his possession \"about five minutes\" when Luxmoore took it back because he had promised to show it to one other person. On returning to his hotel after showing the precious book to Green, Luxmoore was shocked to realize that he had left it in the taxi. Without any delay, Green began calling every taxi company in the city, with no luck. \"I've felt sick since then,\" Luxmoore told reporters. According to Green, no one has yet learned how the diary came to the office building. Tom Brennan received a reward of $ 1,000, Philadelphia gained another treasure for its history, and Luxmoore told reporters, \"It's wonderful news. I'm on high.\"",

It was a nice day out, so the mouse chose to go down by the river to take a quick rest for a bit. When the mouse arrived at the river he found the perfect spot to rest. It was a small little area with soft sand to lie on, under a tree that gave a bit of shade. The mouse then sat back. After a little bit of time the mouse was fast asleep. \n\nNot long after the mouse had fallen asleep, the cat caught a scent in the air of the young mouse. The cat walked slowly up to the spot where the mouse was sleeping and licked his lips. Right when the cat was about to catch the mouse, the mouse woke up. \n\n\"What are you doing?!\" asked the mouse in surprise. \n\n\"I am trying to find dinner,\" said the cat. \n\nThe mouse smiled. \"I collected extra berries today on my walk. Would you like to have some?\" \n\nThe cat was confused. He had never been given such a kind thing. \"Well, OK. Berries are not my favorite, but I guess that they are OK.\" \n\nThe cat and mouse then sat down together and ate a meal of tasty berries.

It has been described by some political theorists including Robert A. Dahl, Gregory Houston and Ian Liebenberg as polyarchy.

He was unselfish to play also when he was not 100 percent.\" \n\nBut the Italian said Drogba was now back to health and would be fit for the league leaders' home clash with Fulham on Wednesday. \n\n\"He suffered obviously but after treatment, he will be better,\" Ancelotti said. \"One time it was serious, now there is the possibility to treat and come back well. He is okay. Tomorrow he will play.\" \n\nAncelotti said Ghana midfielder Michael Essien would return to the Chelsea line-up, having missed the Liverpool game with a toe problem, but Frank Lampard is not yet ready to make his long-awaited return. \n\nThe England midfielder, who has been sidelined following a hernia operation, is scheduled to make his comeback against Sunderland on Sunday. \n\n\"Lampard has been training with us and he is good.

It will be a bitter blow to him when those scoundrels, on their return to Paris, report their utter failure, for he must have considered it impossible that we could escape from the toils he had laid for us. I only wish that we had clear evidence that he is the author of these attempts. If so, I would go straight with Marshal Saxe and lay an accusation against him before the king; but however certain we may feel about it, we have really nothing to connect him with the affair, and it would be madness to accuse a king's favourite unless one could prove absolutely the truth of what one says. However, I hope some day that I shall get even with him. It will not be my fault if I do not.\" \n\nThat night Ronald and his mother debated what would be the best way to proceed in the morning, and finally they agreed that Malcolm should present himself at the prison with the order of release, and that they should remain at the hotel, to which Malcolm should bring Colonel Leslie, after breaking to him the news that his wife and son were both awaiting him. The shock, in any case, of sudden liberty, would be a severe one, and the meeting with his attached comrade would act as a preparation for that with his wife. ",

        "meta": "Los Angeles (CNN) -- Two years after his death, music legend and celebrity icon Michael Jackson's legacy remains clouded by the debate over how he died and who, if anyone, is to blame. \n\nA Los Angeles coroner ruled that a surgical anesthetic called Propofol killed the then 50-year-old Jackson, in combination with several sedatives found in his blood, on June 25, 2009. \n\nEver since, there have been ongoing efforts -- from awards to statues to new songs -- to keep his memory, and music, alive. Still, much of the talk about one of the world's most celebrated singers has occurred in courtrooms, centered around a host of cases related to his untimely death. \n\nAuthorities claim that his personal doctor, Conrad Murray, administered the fatal dose. He has been charged with involuntary manslaughter in the singer's death. The doctor's defense attorney, Ed Chernoff, contends Jackson was \"a desperate man in many respects\" and gave himself the fatal dose of surgical anesthesia while the doctor was not watching. \n\nOne of Michael's sisters, LaToya Jackson, told CNN's Piers Morgan this week that her brother \"told me that they were going to murder him\" -- identifying \"they\" only as \"the people involved in his life, the people that were controlling him.\" \n\nThe late singer's father, Joe Jackson, also fingered unidentified individuals in an interview with CNN on Saturday. \n\n\"We're striving for justice, because there's more to it than they're claiming,\" said Joe Jackson, who has filed a wrongful death lawsuit against Murray and also said he's still fighting over who controls his son's estate. \"There is somebody else involved.\" ",

Knowing I have traveled in the Middle East, she asked me if she should take it. I said it might be interesting in terms of cultural anthropology, but don't expect to enjoy yourself. The social and legal restrictions on women are rampant. \n\nIn the end she turned it down, and one big reason was her trepidation about how she would be treated. \n\nWestern women work in the notoriously misogynistic Gulf States, mostly in PR for governments and doing business with multinationals. But the biggest contingent of foreign women working in those countries -- the millions of Bangladeshi, Indonesian and Filipino servants -- are off the radar. The events of this past week should be regarded as their, and the native women's, silent scream. \n\nMarte Deborah Dalelv, an interior designer working in Qatar, reported being raped last year while on a business trip to Dubai. Although her alleged attacker was arrested and jailed, so was she. A court sentenced her to 16 months in prison for having unlawful sex. \n\nWorld outrage at the Kafkaesque situation apparently provoked the Dubai potentate Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum to \"pardon\" Dalelv. She gets her passport back and is free to go home. She told reporters in Dubai she planned to get out soon. \n\nThe incident should be a wake-up call for any woman, and any man who cares about women, working in or doing business with the petro-cash soaked Gulf States.

Ranging at its greatest extent from the Balkans and Eastern Europe proper in the west to the Indus Valley in the east, it was one of the largest empires in history, spanning 5.5 million square kilometers, and was larger than any previous empire in history. It is equally notable for its successful model of a centralised, bureaucratic administration (through satraps under the King of Kings), for building infrastructure such as road systems and a postal system, the use of an official language across its territories, and the development of civil services and a large professional army. The empire's successes inspired similar systems in later empires. It is noted in Western history as the antagonist of the Greek city-states during the Greco-Persian Wars and for the emancipation of the Jewish exiles in Babylon. \n\nBy the 7th century BC, the Persians had settled in the southwestern portion of the Iranian Plateau in the region of Persis, which came to be their . From this region, Cyrus the Great advanced to defeat the Medes, Lydia, and the Neo-Babylonian Empire, establishing the Achaemenid Empire. Alexander the Great, an avid admirer of Cyrus the Great, conquered most of the empire by 330 BC. Upon his death, most of the empire's former territory came under the rule of the Ptolemaic Kingdom and Seleucid Empire, in addition to other minor territories which gained independence at that time.

Although he was rich and well educated, he did not act as if he considered himself above them. He took a lively interest in all they had to tell, and knew how to \"draw them out,\" so that, almost before he knew it, Andy had related the details of his troubles with his shiftless Uncle Si and with the mysterious Mr. A. Q. Hopton. \n\n\"More than likely that fellow, Hopton, will bear close watching,\" said Barwell Dawson. \"If he is a sharper--and it looks as if he might be--he will try to swindle both you and your uncle. It was very unwise for your uncle to try to do business with him without seeing a lawyer.\" \n\n\"Uncle Si wanted to get the money without my knowing it,\" answered Andy, bitterly. He was glad to open his heart to somebody who could understand him. \n\n\"I believe you--and that is not to your uncle's credit.

Well, you're seven years old now and I think you're ready for a special present.\" \n\nSarah's mother set the basket on the floor. Sarah fell on her knees with a big grin on her face.

Soon it started making gentle sounds. \"Why is the kitty making those funny sounds?\" she asked her mother. \"Oh, that's called purring. It's the sound kittens make when they're happy,\" her mother said. \n\n\"Can I give it a name?\" Sarah asked. \n\n\"Sure. It's a girl kitty, but choose any name you like.\" her mother said. \n\nSarah thought about it as her mother got two small bowls and placed them on the floor. Then she put water in one bowl and kitten food in the other bowl. \"Okay, Sarah. Let's see if the kitty is hungry.\" \n\nSarah put the kitty on the floor and it walked over to the food bowl.

But hard as it was for Danny, it didn't begin to be as hard as the game Lightfoot the Deer was playing with the hunter in the Green Forest. \n\nIn the case of Buster Bear and Danny, the latter had simply to keep out of reach of Buster. As long as Buster didn't get his great paws on Danny, the latter was safe. Then, too, Danny is a very small person. He is so small that he can hide under two or three leaves. Wherever he is, he is pretty sure to find a hiding-place of some sort. His small size gives him advantages in a game of hide and seek. It certainly does. But Lightfoot the Deer is big. He is one of the largest of the people who live in the Green Forest. Being so big, it is not easy to hide. \n\nMoreover, a hunter with a terrible gun does not have to get close in order to kill. Lightfoot knew all this as he waited for the coming of the hunter of whom Sammy Jay had warned him. He had learned many lessons in the hunting season of the year before and he remembered every one of them. He knew that to forget even one of them might cost him his life. So, standing motionless behind a tangle of fallen trees, Lightfoot listened and watched. ",

Bath is in the valley of the River Avon, west of London and south-east of Bristol. The city became a World Heritage Site in 1987. \n\nThe city became a spa with the Latin name \" (\"the waters of Sulis\") \u00a0AD\u00a060 when the Romans built baths and a temple in the valley of the River Avon, although hot springs were known even before then. \n\nBath Abbey was founded in the 7th century and became a religious centre; the building was rebuilt in the 12th and 16th centuries. In the 17th century, claims were made for the curative properties of water from the springs, and Bath became popular as a spa town in the Georgian era. Georgian architecture, crafted from Bath stone, includes the Royal Crescent, Circus, Pump Room, and Assembly Rooms where Beau Nash presided over the city's social life from 1705 until his death in 1761. Many of the streets and squares were laid out by John Wood, the Elder, and in the 18th century the city became fashionable and the population grew. Jane Austen lived in Bath in the early 19th century. Further building was undertaken in the 19th century and following the Bath Blitz in World War II.",

When her first sister was born, Lin took turns with her mom holding the baby late into the night. \"I almost did everything that was supposed to be a parent's job, but I felt proud of myself,\" she said. Not all of Lin's classmates shared her experiences because of the family planning policy , a law that was carried out in China about forty years ago. But the situation is about to change. A new policy made on October 29 said all couples can now have two children. The new policy is expected to help raise the population of China. Recently, China has been facing an aging population and labor shortages because of the low birth rate . The two-child policy may also be the gift for every only child. Researchers found that growing up with a brother or sister can have good influence on one's mental health. \"Brothers and sisters do matter in unique ways. They give kids something that parents don't.\" Laura Walker, a professor from Beijing University, told China Daily. She noted that having a brother or a sister protects teenagers against loneliness, fear and so on. Liu Fang, 20, from Shenzhen University, has a 2-year-younger sister. When her sister disagreed with parents over choosing a college major, she helped her to communicate with parents. \"If necessary, I would always have her back,\" said Liu. \"The best part of having a sister is that you have a partner, friend and supporter throughout your life.\" But children with brothers or sisters also have to learn to understand and look after each other, said Laura.",

Her piercing blue eyes dart around the room -- at her family, at the cameras broadcasting live to televisions around Australia, at the ground, at her interpreter. Then reality sets in. \n\nGuilty -- the judge said. Her sentence? Twenty years in a Bali prison. \n\nAt the back of the court, members of her family erupt with anger. \n\n\"It's not alright! How dare you?\" screams her sister, Mercedes. \n\n\"We swore on the Bible to tell the truth and your fellow lied!\" her mother, Rosleigh Rose, booms at the prosecutors. \n\nAs her daughter is led away, Rose makes a promise: \"Schapelle, you will come home. Our government will bring you home.\" \n\nNot since Lindy Chamberlain claimed a dingo took her baby in the Outback have Australians become so caught up in a courtroom drama. Nearly nine years on from the verdict, interest remains strong enough to sustain a soon-to-be-broadcast Australian telemovie based on the case. \n\nAnd now Corby has walked out of prison -- on parole but free.

        "meta": "I shall never forget the night, a few years ago, when Marion J. Douglas was a student in one of my calsses. (I have not used his real name for personal reasons. As he requested.) But here is his real story as he told it before one of our adult - education classes. He told us how tragedy had struck at his home, not once, but twice. The first time he had lost his five-old daughter, a child he adored. He and his wife thought they couldn't bear that first loss; but, as he said:\"Ten months later, God gave us another little girl and she died in five days.\" \n\nThis double \n\nwas almost too much to bear. \"I couldn't take it,\" this father told us. \"I couldn't sleep, I couldn't eat, I couldn't rest or relax. My nerves were entirely shaken and my confidence gone.\" At last he went to doctors; one recommended sleeping pills and another recommended a trip. He tried both, but neither helped. He said:\"My body felt as if it was surrounded in a vice , and the jaws of the vice were being drawn tighter and tighter.\" The tension of grief ----if you have ever been paralyzed by sorrow, you know what he meant. \n\nBut thank God, I had one child left ----a four --year-- old son. He gave me the solution to my problem. One afternoon as I sat around feeling sorry for myself, he asked; 'Daddy, will you build a boat for me?' I was in no mood to build a boat; in fact, I was in no mood to do anything. But my son is a persistent little fellow! I had to give in. \n\nBuilding that toy boat took me about three hours. By the time it was finished, I realized that those three hours spent building that boat were first hours of mental relaxation and peace that I had had in months! I realized that it is difficult to worry while you are busy doing something that requires planning and thinking. In my case, building the boat had knocked worry out of the ring. So I determined to keep busy. \n\nThe following night, I went from room to room in the house, making a list of jobs that ought to be done. Scores of items needed to be repaired: bookcase, stair steps, storm windows, window-shades, locks, leaky taps. Amazing as it seems, in the course of two weeks I had made a list of 242 items that needed attention. \n\n\"During the last two years I have completed most of them. I am busy now that I have no time for worry.\" \n\nNo time for worry! That is exactly what Winston Churchill said when he was working eighteen hours a day at the height of the war. When he was asked if he worried about his huge responsibilities, he said :\"I am too busy. I have no time for worry.\"",

I came to realize that I was ignoring her as a father. \n\nElla isn't the only kid who feels this way about her parent's relationship with devices. Catherine Steiner-Adair, a psychologist at Harvard, wrote The Big Disconnect: Protecting Childhood and Family Relationships in the Digital Age. For her book, Steiner-Adair interviewed more than 1,000 kids from the ages of 4 to 18. She talked to hundreds of teachers and parents. \n\nOne of the many things that knocked my socks off, \" she says, \"was the consistency with which children -- whether they were 4 or 8 or 18 or 24-- talked about feeling exhausted and frustrated or mad trying to get their parents' attention, competing with computer screens or iPhone screens or any kind of technology.\" \n\nA couple of years ago, my daughter got a laptop for school. And because she was becoming more independent, we got her a phone. We set up rules for when she could use the device and when she'd need to put it away. We created a charging station, outside her bedroom, where she had to plug in these devices every night. Basically -- except for homework-- she has to put it all away when she comes home. \n\nSteiner-Adair says most adults don't set up similar limits in their own lives. \"We've lost the boundaries that protect work and family life,'' she says. \"So it is very hard to manage yourself and be present in the moments your children need you.'' \n\nAfter my daughter's little intervention ,I made myself a promise to create my own charging station. To plug my phone in-- somewhere faraway -- when I am done working for the day. I've been trying to leave it there untouched for most of the weekend",

With a cigar in his mouth, and his hands behind his back, he was strolling about his handsomely furnished sitting-room at Claridge's, dictating to a secretary, while from an adjoining room came the faint click of a typewriter. Virginia entered somewhat unceremoniously, followed by Guy. Phineas Duge looked at them both in some surprise. \n\n\"Uncle,\" she said, \"I met Guy coming away from Coniston Mansions. He was looking for me, and I have brought him to see you.\" \n\nPhineas Duge held out his hand, and in obedience to a gesture, the secretary got up and left the room. \n\n\"I am very glad to meet you, sir,\" he said. \"By the by, my niece has only mentioned your first name.\" \n\n\"I am the Duke of Mowbray,\" Guy said simply, \"and I am very glad indeed to meet you if you are Virginia's uncle. I think that she treated me rather badly a week ago, but I am disposed,\" he added, with a twinkle in his eyes, \"to be forgiving. I want your niece to be my wife, sir.\" \n\n\"Indeed!\" Mr. Duge answered a little drily. \"I can't say that I am glad to hear it, as I have only just discovered her myself.\" \n\n\"There is no reason, sir,\" Guy answered, \"why you should lose her.\" \n\n\"You don't even know my uncle's name yet,\" Virginia said, smiling. \n\n\"I am Phineas Duge,\" Duge answered. \"I dare say you have never heard of me. You see, I don't come often to England.\" ",

        "meta": "Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of knowledge, skills, values, beliefs, and habits. Educational methods include storytelling, discussion, teaching, training, and directed research. Education frequently takes place under the guidance of educators, but learners may also educate themselves. Education can take place in formal or informal settings and any experience that has a formative effect on the way one thinks, feels, or acts may be considered educational. The methodology of teaching is called pedagogy. \n\nAfter the Fall of Rome, the Catholic Church became the sole preserver of literate scholarship in Western Europe. The church established cathedral schools in the Early Middle Ages as centers of advanced education. Some of these establishments ultimately evolved into medieval universities and forebears of many of Europe's modern universities. During the High Middle Ages, Chartres Cathedral operated the famous and influential Chartres Cathedral School. The medieval universities of Western Christendom were well-integrated across all of Western Europe, encouraged freedom of inquiry, and produced a great variety of fine scholars and natural philosophers, including Thomas Aquinas of the University of Naples, Robert Grosseteste of the University of Oxford, an early expositor of a systematic method of scientific experimentation, and Saint Albert the Great, a pioneer of biological field research. Founded in 1088, the University of Bologne is considered the first, and the oldest continually operating university.",

Arthur was talkative when speaking to his friends, yet he had trouble finding words when he had to write. \n\nBy bedtime Arthur had drawn a picture of Toby smiling. He had drawn a tree with its branches blowing in the strong wind. He had also written a note asking his friend Lee to go to the movies on Saturday. But he had not written a single word of his story. \n\nOn Wednesday, Mrs. Solomon, Arthur's English teacher, asked the class to turn in the first draft of their stories. His heart sinking, Arthur turned in the only work he had--the page with his name, the drawings and the note. \n\nArthur wasn't surprised when Mrs. Solomon asked him to stay after class the next day.

It looked as if it might rain, so Mike carried his umbrella. Suddenly a big storm blew in, bending the trees. The noise of the wind sounded like the barking of Mike's dog Toby. Toby really hated storms and barked whenever he wanted to be let inside. Then Mike realized that it wasn't the sound of the wind. It was Toby. The dog was running after him down the busy street, barking. The sound was filled with blame. Mike felt guilty because he had left Toby outside. He turned and headed home with Toby running beside him. Mike let Toby in the door just as the rain started to pour down. \" \n\nArthur had a story in the end.

        "meta": "An atoll (, , , , or ), sometimes called a coral atoll, is a ring-shaped coral reef including a coral rim that encircles a lagoon partially or completely. There may be coral islands/cays on the rim. The coral of the atoll often sits atop the rim of an extinct seamount or volcano which has eroded or subsided partially beneath the water. The lagoon forms over the volcanic crater or caldera while the higher rim remains above water or at shallow depths that permit the coral to grow and form the reefs. For the atoll to persist, continued erosion or subsidence must be at a rate slow enough to permit reef growth upwards and outwards to replace the lost height. \n\nThe word \"atoll\" comes from the Dhivehi (an Indo-Aryan language spoken on the Maldive Islands) word \"atholhu\" (Dhivehi: , ), meaning an administrative subdivision. Its first recorded use in English was in 1625 as \"atollon\" \u2013 Charles Darwin recognized its indigenous origin and coined, in his \"The Structure and Distribution of Coral Reefs\", the definition of atolls as \"circular groups of coral islets\" that is synonymous with \"lagoon-island\". \n\nMore modern definitions of \"atoll\" describe them as \"annular reefs enclosing a lagoon in which there are no promontories other than reefs and islets composed of reef detritus\" or \"in an exclusively morphological sense, [as] a ring-shaped ribbon reef enclosing a lagoon\".",

The current archbishop is Justin Welby. His enthronement took place at Canterbury Cathedral on 21 March 2013. Welby is the 105th in a line which goes back more than 1400 years to Augustine of Canterbury, the \"Apostle to the English\", sent from Rome in the year 597. Welby succeeded Rowan Williams. \n\nFrom the time of St Augustine of Canterbury in the 6th century, until Archbishop Reginald Pole in the 16th century, the Archbishops of Canterbury were in full communion with the See of Rome and they usually received the pallium. During the English Reformation, based upon King Henry VIII's divorce from Catherine of Aragon, the Church of England broke away from the authority of the Pope and the Roman Catholic Church. \n\nIn the Middle Ages there was considerable variation in the methods of nomination of the Archbishop of Canterbury and other bishops. At various times the choice was made by the canons of Canterbury Cathedral, the Pope, or the King of England. Since the English Reformation, the Church of England has been more explicitly a state church and the choice is legally that of the Crown; today it is made by the Queen on the advice of the Prime Minister, who receives a shortlist of two names from an \"ad hoc\" committee called the Crown Nominations Commission.",

I didn't know exactly what to expect. But it feels better,\" the 21-year-old told the WTA Tour website. \"I'm very happy about the way I felt out there today. I got into the rhythm as the match went on tonight.\" \n\nWho will be the 2012 Australian Open victors? \n\nWozniacki will next play Georgia's 83rd-ranked Anna Tatishvili, who beat Australia's Ashleigh Barty 6-2 7-6 (7-4). \n\nFormer No. 1 Clijsters made a strong start to the defense of her crown with a 7-5 6-1 defeat of Portuguese qualifier Maria Joao Koehler. \n\nThe Belgian 11th seed, who will play France's world No. 98 Stephanie Foretz Gacon in the last 64, showed little sign of the hip injury which forced her out of the Brisbane International 10 days ago. \n\n\"I wanted to go out there and I wanted to start playing,\" the 28-year-old told the tournament's official website. \"I've had that ever since we came to Australia. \n\n\"I had a good off-season where we worked obviously to try to be in good shape for Australia, then you want to put that to the test and play those matches again.\" ",

        "meta": "Wool is the textile fiber obtained from sheep and other animals, including cashmere and mohair from goats, qiviut from muskoxen, angora from rabbits, and other types of wool from camelids. Wool mainly consists of protein together with a few percent lipids. In this regard it is chemically quite distinct from the more dominant textile, cotton, which is mainly cellulose. \n\nWool is produced by follicles which are small cells located in the skin. These follicles are located in the upper layer of the skin called the epidermis and push down into the second skin layer called the dermis as the wool fibers grow. Follicles can be classed as either primary or secondary follicles. Primary follicles produce three types of fiber: kemp, medullated fibers and true wool fibers. Secondary follicles only produce true wool fibers. Medullated fibers share nearly identical characteristics to hair and are long but lack crimp and elasticity. Kemp fibers are very coarse and shed out. Wool's scaling and crimp make it easier to spin the fleece by helping the individual fibers attach to each other, so they stay together. Because of the crimp, wool fabrics have greater bulk than other textiles, and they hold air, which causes the fabric to retain heat. Wool has a high specific heat coefficient, so it impedes heat transfer in general. This effect has benefited desert peoples, as Bedouins and Tuaregs use wool clothes for insulation.",

Probably he had no idea, but felt at the spur of the moment that it would be weak to yield. The consequence was, that when Lady Desmond left Hap House, he was obliged to consider himself as being at feud with the family. \n\nThe young lord he did see once again during the holidays, and even entertained him at Hap House; but the earl's pride would not give way an inch. \n\n\"Much as I like you, Owen, I cannot do anything but oppose it. It would be a bad match for my sister, and so you'd feel if you were in my place.\" And then Lord Desmond went back to Eton. \n\nAfter that they none of them met for many months. During this time life went on in a very triste manner at Desmond Court. Lady Desmond felt that she had done her duty by her daughter; but her tenderness to Clara was not increased by the fact that her foolish attachment had driven Fitzgerald from the place. As for Clara herself, she not only kept her word, but rigidly resolved to keep it. Twice she returned unopened, and without a word of notice, letters which Owen had caused to be conveyed to her hand. It was not that she had ceased to love him, but she had high ideas of truth and honour, and would not break her word. Perhaps she was sustained in her misery by the remembrance that heroines are always miserable. ",

Her six-month-old son Corey had swallowed an earring and the young mother couldn't ring for help because something was wrong with her phone. The three teenagers rushed to the aid of Ms Price, called an ambulance , calmed her down and waited with her until the ambulance arrived before heading to school. \n\nMs Price, Corey and his grandmother Joyce Finnie visited the school last Thursday to thank the boys for their kind action. \"It's good to know that there are still some good people who will stop and help,\" Ms Price said. \"While I was shouting for help, a woman walking her dog went straight past, without stopping. I don't know what would have happened if these boys had not stopped.\" \n\nThe teenagers were shocked at the attention they received at school for their heroic act but admitted that the incident was nerve-racking . \"We heard her shouting so we knew something wasn't right,\" Andrew said. \"We thought someone had died. It was scary but we just did what we had to do.\" \n\nJust as proud as the boys' parents is their principal, Tim McCallum. \n\nAfter two days in hospital, Corey has now fully recovered. \"He's got two new teeth to show,\" Ms Price said. \"I have to keep a closer eye on him. He's into everything now and grabs whatever he finds to put it straight into his mouth.\"",

Founded in 1847, and formerly self-styled as the \"World's Greatest Newspaper\" (for which WGN radio and television are named), it remains the most-read daily newspaper of the Chicago metropolitan area and the Great Lakes region. It is the eighth-largest newspaper in the United States by circulation (and became the second-largest under Tribune's ownership after the \"Chicago Tribune\"s parent company purchased the \"Los Angeles Times\"). \n\nTraditionally published as a broadsheet, on January 13, 2009, the \"Tribune\" announced it would continue publishing as a broadsheet for home delivery, but would publish in tabloid format for newsstand, news box, and commuter station sales. This change, however, proved to be unpopular with readers and in August 2011, the \"Tribune\" discontinued the tabloid edition, returning to its traditional broadsheet edition through all distribution channels. \n\nThe \"Tribune\"s masthead is notable for displaying the American flag, in reference to the paper's motto, \"An American Paper for Americans.\" The motto is no longer displayed on the masthead, where it was placed below the flag. \n\nThe \"Tribune\" was founded by James Kelly, John E. Wheeler, and Joseph K. C. Forrest, publishing the first edition on June 10, 1847. Numerous changes in ownership and editorship took place over the next eight years. Initially, the \"Tribune\" was not politically affiliated, but tended to support either the Whig or Free Soil parties against the Democrats in elections. By late 1853, it was frequently running xenophobic editorials that criticized foreigners and Roman Catholics. About this time it also became a strong proponent of temperance. However nativist its editorials may have been, it was not until February 10, 1855 that the \"Tribune\" formally affiliated itself with the nativist American or Know Nothing party, whose candidate Levi Boone was elected Mayor of Chicago the following month.",

He was determined to succeed. Even mountains did not stop Rick Hansen. He wheeled himself up the Rocky Mountains and several other major mountains in the world. He even wheeled himself along the Great Wall of China! \n\n\"Never Give Up On Your Dreams\" was his motto and he hasn't given up yet. He completed his world tour raising $24 million.

Its capital city is Kiel; other notable cities are L\u00fcbeck and Flensburg. \n\nAlso known in more dated English as Sleswick-Holsatia, the Danish name is \"Slesvig-Holsten,\" the Low German name is \"Sleswig-Holsteen,\" and the North Frisian name is \"Slaswik-Holstiinj.\" Historically, the name can also refer to a larger region, containing both present-day Schleswig-Holstein and the former South Jutland County (Northern Schleswig) in Denmark. \n\nThe term \"Holstein\" derives from Old Saxon \"Holseta Land,\" (\"Holz\" and \"Holt\" mean wood in modern Standardised German and in literary English, respectively). Originally, it referred to the central of the three Saxon tribes north of the River Elbe: \"Tedmarsgoi\" (Dithmarschen), Holstein and \"Sturmarii\" (Stormarn). The area of the tribe of the Holsts was between the St\u00f6r River and Hamburg, and after Christianization, their main church was in Schenefeld. Saxon Holstein became a part of the Holy Roman Empire after Charlemagne's Saxon campaigns in the late eighth century. Since 811, the northern frontier of Holstein (and thus the Empire) was marked by the River Eider. \n\nThe term Schleswig comes from the city of Schleswig. The name derives from the Schlei inlet in the east and \"vik\" meaning inlet in Old Norse or settlement in Old Saxon, and linguistically identical (cognate) with the \"-wick\" or \"-wich\" element in place-names in Britain.",

Originating in the steppes of Central Asia, the Mongol Empire eventually stretched from Eastern Europe to the Sea of Japan, extending northwards into Siberia, eastwards and southwards into the Indian subcontinent, Indochina, and the Iranian plateau, and westwards as far as the Levant. \n\nThe Mongol Empire emerged from the unification of nomadic tribes in the Mongol homeland under the leadership of Genghis Khan, whom a council proclaimed ruler of all the Mongols in 1206. The empire grew rapidly under his rule and that of his descendants, who sent invasions in every direction. The vast transcontinental empire connected the east with the west with an enforced \"Pax Mongolica\", allowing the dissemination and exchange of trade, technologies, commodities, and ideologies across Eurasia. \n\nThe empire began to split due to wars over succession, as the grandchildren of Genghis Khan disputed whether the royal line should follow from his son and initial heir \u00d6gedei or from one of his other sons, such as Tolui, Chagatai, or Jochi. The Toluids prevailed after a bloody purge of \u00d6gedeid and Chagataid factions, but disputes continued even among the descendants of Tolui. A key reason for the split was the dispute over whether the Mongol Empire would become a sedentary, cosmopolitan empire, or would stay true to their nomadic and steppe lifestyle. After M\u00f6ngke Khan died (1259), rival kurultai councils simultaneously elected different successors, the brothers Ariq B\u00f6ke and Kublai Khan, who then not only fought each other in the Toluid Civil War (1260\u20131264), but also dealt with challenges from descendants of other sons of Genghis. Kublai successfully took power, but civil war ensued as Kublai sought unsuccessfully to regain control of the Chagatayid and \u00d6gedeid families.",

Much of the West is marking the anniversary with new translations of the author's works, including War and Peace. Movies are being released, including a black-and-white documentary and a feature film. In short, everyone is celebrating. Everyone, that is, except for people in Tolstoy's home country, Russia. \n\nThe English newspaper the Guardian reports that the Russian government has scheduled nothing for November, the official anniversary of Tolstoy's death. The quiet is amazing, considering the importance of this man's contribution to global culture. \n\n\"Across the whole world there is a huge Tolstoy boom ,\" Andrei Deryabin, co-producer of a new film about the author's final days titled The Last Station, told the Guardian. \"He's esteemed everywhere apart from here in Russia.\" \n\nExperts explain the government's silence in various ways. Some refer to Tolstoy's disagreement with state-backed religion. Tolstoy's Christian views often _ those of the Roman Catholic church. \n\nHis great grandson, Vladimir Ilyich Tolstoy, thinks Russia's cool attitude has more to do with history and the author's positive worldview. After all, the last century was a difficult one of the country's people. The darker writings of Fyodor Dostoevsky, he says, better fit the national character. Tolstoy hopes that as Russians grow more optimistic they will rediscover one of their own national treasures. \n\n\"Tolstoy gives positive answers to the questions mankind is asking,\" he told the Guardian. \" In this sense he gives more hope. I hope the 21stcentury is Tolstoyan.\"",

Cy Bogart wants to go--he's a brat but he's lively.\" \n\n\"I don't think the doctor can go,\" sedately. \"He said something about having to make a country call this afternoon. But I'd love to.\" \n\n\"That's dandy! Who can we get?\" \n\n\"Mrs. Dyer might be chaperon. She's been so nice. And maybe Dave, if he could get away from the store.\" \n\n\"How about Erik Valborg? I think he's got lots more style than these town boys. You like him all right, don't you?\" \n\nSo the picnic of Carol, Fern, Erik, Cy Bogart, and the Dyers was not only moral but inevitable. \n\nThey drove to the birch grove on the south shore of Lake Minniemashie. Dave Dyer was his most clownish self. He yelped, jigged, wore Carol's hat, dropped an ant down Fern's back, and when they went swimming (the women modestly changing in the car with the side curtains up, the men undressing behind the bushes, constantly repeating, \"Gee, hope we don't run into poison ivy\"), Dave splashed water on them and dived to clutch his wife's ankle. He infected the others. Erik gave an imitation of the Greek dancers he had seen in vaudeville, and when they sat down to picnic supper spread on a lap-robe on the grass, Cy climbed a tree to throw acorns at them. ",

Their powers include the legitimized use of force. The term is most commonly associated with police services of a sovereign state that are authorized to exercise the police power of that state within a defined legal or territorial area of responsibility. Police forces are often defined as being separate from military or other organizations involved in the defense of the state against foreign aggressors; however, gendarmerie are military units charged with civil policing. \n\nLaw enforcement, however, constitutes only part of policing activity. Policing has included an array of activities in different situations, but the predominant ones are concerned with the preservation of order. In some societies, in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, these developed within the context of maintaining the class system and the protection of private property. Many police forces suffer from police corruption to a greater or lesser degree. The police force is usually a public sector service, meaning they are paid through taxes.",

That's my hunch. There's a big strike coming, and Indian River ain't going to be a million miles away.\" \n\n\"And the place is swarming with moose,\" Joe Ladue added. \"Bob Henderson's up there somewhere, been there three years now, swearing something big is going to happen, living off'n straight moose and prospecting around like a crazy man.\" \n\nDaylight decided to go Indian River a flutter, as he expressed it; but Elijah could not be persuaded into accompanying him. Elijah's soul had been seared by famine, and he was obsessed by fear of repeating the experience. \n\n\"I jest can't bear to separate from grub,\" he explained. \"I know it's downright foolishness, but I jest can't help it.

That's not my job,\" Rodman told CNN's Chris Cuomo on \"New Day\" Friday. \n\nIt was his first interview since entering an alcohol rehabilitation facility two weeks ago. \n\nThe former basketball player is probably the American with the most access to the North Korean leader, and many have been critical that he has not lobbied for the release of American prisoner Kenneth Bae from a labor camp. \n\n\"I'm not an ambassador, and I tried to strive and tell people, just because I know the marshal (Kim), that doesn't mean I know the marshal like that,\" he said. \n\nRodman says he didn't mean to insinuate during an earlier interview this month that he knew why Bae, a Korean-American, was being held in North Korea. \n\n\"To this day I still don't know what he did,\" Rodman said, even offering to take Bae's place if he could. \n\n\"I feel for (Bae's family). I feel for them deeply. ... I would do anything literally. This is Dennis Rodman talking. If they (North Korea) said, 'We'll take Dennis Rodman and we'll let Kenenth Bae go,' I'll say, 'You know what? I'll do that. ... Take me.'\" ",

It's unnatural.\" \n\nBut perhaps there is more to it than just social awkwardness. \n\n\"In the back of our minds we are a little anxious,\" says Nick White,an office in New York who was unfortunate enough to be trapped in a lift for41 hours. \"We don't like to be locked into a place.We want to get out of the elevator as soon as possible, you know, it's a frightening place to be.\" \n\nDuring his terrible experience, he began to think of another encloses space-a tomb. \n\nDr.Lee Gray agrees that a sense of disempowerment is the main cause of life anxiety. \n\n\"You're in a machine that's moving, over which you have no control.

She had sent one courier with a respectful letter of excuse to His Royal Highness, begging for a postponement of the august visit on account of pressing and urgent business, and another on ahead to bespeak a fresh relay of horses at Faversham. \n\nThen she had changed her muslin frock for a dark traveling costume and mantle, had provided herself with money--which her husband's lavishness always placed fully at her disposal--and had started on her way. \n\nShe did not attempt to delude herself with any vain and futile hopes; the safety of her brother Armand was to have been conditional on the imminent capture of the Scarlet Pimpernel. As Chauvelin had sent her back Armand's compromising letter, there was no doubt that he was quite satisfied in his own mind that Percy Blakeney was the man whose death he had sworn to bring about. \n\nNo! there was no room for any fond delusions! Percy, the husband whom she loved with all the ardour which her admiration for his bravery had kindled, was in immediate, deadly peril, through her hand. She had betrayed him to his enemy--unwittingly 'tis true--but she HAD betrayed him, and if Chauvelin succeeded in trapping him, who so far was unaware of his danger, then his death would be at her door. His death! when with her very heart's blood, she would have defended him and given willingly her life for his. ",

Fortunately Felicity forgot to repeat the command, so Dan did stay in bed. Cecily carried his meals to him, and read a Henty book to him all her spare time. The Story Girl went up and told him wondrous tales; and Sara Ray brought him a pudding she had made herself. Sara's intentions were good, but the pudding-- well, Dan fed most of it to Paddy, who had curled himself up at the foot of the bed, giving the world assurance of a cat by his mellifluous purring. \n\n\"Ain't he just a great old fellow?\" said Dan. \"He knows I'm kind of sick, just as well as a human. He never pays no attention to me when I'm well.\" \n\nFelix and Peter and I were required to help Uncle Roger in some carpentering work that day, and Felicity indulged in one of the house-cleaning orgies so dear to her soul; so that it was evening before we were all free to meet in the orchard and loll on the grasses of Uncle Stephen's Walk. In August it was a place of shady sweetness, fragrant with the odour of ripening apples, full of dear, delicate shadows. Through its openings we looked afar to the blue rims of the hills and over green, old, tranquil fields, lying the sunset glow. Overhead the lacing leaves made a green, murmurous roof. There was no such thing as hurry in the world, while we lingered there and talked of \"cabbages and kings.\" A tale of the Story Girl's, wherein princes were thicker than blackberries, and queens as common as buttercups, led to our discussion of kings. We wondered what it would be like to be a king. Peter thought it would be fine, only kind of inconvenient, wearing a crown all the time. ",

The Assembly comprises 60 members, who are known as Assembly Members, or AMs (\"Aelodau y Cynulliad\"). Since 2011, Members are elected for five-year terms under an additional members system, in which 40 AMs represent geographical constituencies elected by the plurality system, and 20 AMs represent five electoral regions using the d'Hondt method of proportional representation. \n\nThe Assembly was created by the Government of Wales Act 1998, which followed a referendum in 1997. The Assembly had no powers to initiate primary legislation until limited law-making powers were gained through the Government of Wales Act 2006. Its primary law-making powers were enhanced following a Yes vote in the referendum on 3 March 2011, making it possible for it to legislate without having to consult the UK parliament or the Secretary of State for Wales in the 20 areas that are devolved. \n\nAn appointed Council for Wales and Monmouthshire was established in 1949 to \"ensure the government is adequately informed of the impact of government activities on the general life of the people of Wales\". The council had 27 members nominated by local authorities in Wales, the University of Wales, National Eisteddfod Council and the Welsh Tourist Board. A post of Minister of Welsh Affairs was created in 1951 and the post of Secretary of State for Wales and the Welsh Office were established in 1964 leading to the abolition of the Council for Wales. The establishment of the Welsh Office effectively created the basis for the territorial governance of Wales. The Royal Commission on the Constitution (the Kilbrandon Commission) was set up in 1969 by Harold Wilson's Labour Government to investigate the possibility of devolution for Scotland and Wales. Its recommendations formed the basis of the 1974 White Paper \"Democracy and Devolution: proposals for Scotland and Wales\", which proposed the creation of a Welsh Assembly. However, voters rejected the proposals by a majority of four to one in a referendum held in 1979.",

They also send wishes for family members not with them. There are many stories about the moon to make the tradition more interesting. In China, Chang'e flying to the moon is a well-known legend . Hou Yi and Chang'e were husband and wife in old times. At the time, there were 10 suns in the sky. Hou yi, a brave man, shot down nine suns. People see Hou Yi as a great hero. Besides China, many other countries have beautiful stories about the moon. In Greek legend , Artemis is the goddess of the moon. She takes care of the hunt and wild animals. Artemis also looks after young children and women in childbirth . In India, the god of the moon is Soma. He has four hands and rides through the sky in a chariot .

The Kingdom of Montenegro had united with Serbia five days previously, while the regions of Kosovo, Vojvodina and Vardar Macedonia were parts of Serbia prior to the unification. \n\nFor its first eleven years of existence, the Kingdom was officially called the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, but the term \"Yugoslavia\" was its colloquial name from its origins. The official name of the state was changed to \"Kingdom of Yugoslavia\" by King Alexander I on 3 October 1929. \n\nThe state was ruled by the Serbian dynasty of Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107, which previously ruled the Kingdom of Serbia under Peter I from 1903 (after the May Overthrow) onwards. Peter I became the first king of Yugoslavia until his death in 1921. He was succeeded by his son Alexander I, who had been regent for his father. He was known as \"Alexander the Unifier\" and he renamed the kingdom \"Yugoslavia\" in 1929. He was assassinated in Marseille by Vlado Chernozemski, a member of the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization (IMRO), during his visit to France in 1934. The crown passed to his then-still under-aged son Peter. His cousin Paul ruled as Prince regent until 1941, when Peter II would come of age. The royal family flew to London the same year, prior to the country being invaded by the Axis powers.",

It has been very hard to keep our courage alight of late. The Caporetto disaster is a dreadful thing and not even Susan can extract much consolation out of the present state of affairs. The rest of us don't try. Gertrude keeps saying desperately, 'They must not get Venice--they must not get Venice,' as if by saying it often enough she can prevent them. But what is to prevent them from getting Venice I cannot see. Yet, as Susan fails not to point out, there was seemingly nothing to prevent them from getting to Paris in 1914, yet they did not get it, and she affirms they shall not get Venice either. Oh, how I hope and pray they will not--Venice the beautiful Queen of the Adriatic. Although I've never seen it I feel about it just as Byron did--I've always loved it--it has always been to me 'a fairy city of the heart.' Perhaps I caught my love of it from Walter, who worshipped it. It was always one of his dreams to see Venice. I remember we planned once--down in Rainbow Valley one evening just before the war broke out--that some time we would go together to see it and float in a gondola through its moonlit streets. ",

He learned geography from Stoj, the professor, astrography from Fudj, the assistant, together with giliodesy, orgastrophy and other native Russian studies. \n\nAll day he worked. His industry was unflagging. His instructors were enthusiastic. \"If he goes on like this,\" they said, \"he will some day know something.\" \n\n\"It is marvellous,\" said one. \"If he continues thus, he will be a professor.\" \n\n\"He is too young,\" said Stoj, shaking his head. \"He has too much hair.\" \n\n\"He sees too well,\" said Fudj. \"Let him wait till his eyes are weaker.\" \n\nBut all day as Serge worked he thought. And his thoughts were of Olga Ileyitch, the girl that he had seen with Kwartz, inspector of police. He wondered why she had killed Popoff, the inspector. He wondered if she was dead. There seemed no justice in it. \n\nOne day he questioned his professor. \n\n\"Is the law just?\" he said. \"Is it right to kill?\" \n\nBut Stoj shook his head, and would not answer. \n\n\"Let us go on with our orgastrophy,\" he said. And he trembled so that the chalk shook in his hand. \n\nSo Serge questioned no further, but he thought more deeply still. All the way from the Teknik to the house where he lodged he was thinking. As he climbed the stair to his attic room he was still thinking. \n\nThe house in which Serge lived was the house of Madame Vasselitch. It was a tall dark house in a sombre street. There were no trees upon the street and no children played there. And opposite to the house of Madame Vasselitch was a building of stone, with windows barred, that was always silent. In it were no lights, and no one went in or out. ",

But there is much more to her story than how she captivates the cameras on the red carpet. \n\nCNN's Stephanie Elam caught up with Nyong'o to speak about her journey from Kenya to Hollywood. An edited version of the interview follows. \n\nCNN: How did you end up being born in Mexico? \n\nLupita Nyong'o: My father is a politician.

One after another, the next six drivers arriving at the tollbooth were informed, \"Some lady up ahead already paid your fare.\" \n\nIt turned out that the woman, Natalie Smith, had read something on a friend's refrigerator: \"Practice random kindness and senseless acts of beauty.\" The phrase impressed her so much that she copied it down. \n\nJudy Foreman spotted the same phrase on a warehouse wall far away from home. When it stayed on her mind for days, she gave up and drove all the way back to copy it down. \"I thought it was beautiful,\" she said, explaining why she'd taken to writing it at the bottom of all her letters, \"like a message from above.\" Her husband, Frank, liked the phrase so much that he put it up on the classroom wall for his students, one of whom was the daughter of Alice Johnson, a local news reporter. Alice put it in the newspaper, admitting that though she liked it, she didn't know where it came from or what it really meant. \n\nTwo days later, Alice got a call from Anne Herbert, a woman living in Marin. It was in a restaurant that Anne wrote the phrase down on a piece of paper, after turning it around in her mind for days. \n\n\"Here's the idea,\" Anne says. \"Anything you think there should be more of, do it randomly.\" Her fantasies include painting the classrooms of shabby schools, leaving hot meals on kitchen tables in the poor part of town, and giving money secretly to a proud old lady. Anne says, \" _ .\" \n\nThe acts of random kindness spread. If you were one of those drivers who found your fare paid, who knows what you might have been inspired to do for someone else later.

His Marxist\u2013Leninist theories, military strategies and political policies are collectively known as Maoism or Marxism\u2013Leninism\u2013Maoism. \n\nBorn the son of a wealthy farmer in Shaoshan, Hunan, Mao adopted a Chinese nationalist and anti-imperialist outlook in early life, particularly influenced by the events of the Xinhai Revolution of 1911 and May Fourth Movement of 1919. Mao adopted Marxism\u2013Leninism while working at Peking University and became a founding member of the Communist Party of China (CPC), leading the Autumn Harvest Uprising in 1927. During the Chinese Civil War between the Kuomintang (KMT) and the CPC, Mao helped to found the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army, led the Jiangxi Soviet's radical land policies and ultimately became head of the CPC during the Long March. Although the CPC temporarily allied with the KMT under the United Front during the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937\u20131945), after Japan's defeat China's civil war resumed and in 1949 Mao's forces defeated the Nationalists who withdrew to Taiwan.",

        "meta": "(CNN) -- The Supreme Court has just agreed to take on the case of Fisher v. University of Texas. Abigail Fisher, a white woman, argues that she has been a victim of the university's race-conscious admission policies; the university contends that its drive for racial and ethnic diversity is educationally enriching -- a benefit to all students. \n\nWill the ugly discourse that generally characterizes debate over racially preferential policies disappear with the wave of a magic Supreme Court wand? It seems unlikely. The issue is a cat with many more than nine lives. It arrived in the early 1970s and, despite many attacks, some of which have taken the form of amendments to state constitutions, it has survived in pretty fine fettle. \n\nThe court will have only eight justices to hear the arguments. Elena Kagan, having been involved in the case as solicitor general in the Obama administration, has bowed out of participation. Her absence, however, leaves five justices likely to express at least some degree of skepticism about the racial preferences given to non-Asian minorities in the admissions process. \n\nHas the University of Texas been enriched by academic diversity? Maybe. But equally likely is the possibility that racial double standards reinforce stereotypes about smart whites and even smarter Asians. There are certainly wide gaps in the average SAT scores between blacks and Hispanics, on the one hand, and whites and Asians, on the other hand. \n\nAmong freshmen entering the University of Texas in 2009 who did not fall into the top 10% of their high school class (automatic admission at the university), Asians scored at the 93rd percentile of 2009 SAT takers nationwide, whites at the 89th percentile, Hispanics at the 80th percentile and blacks at the 52nd percentile. Startling? No. This picture has been well known for a long time. Heartbreaking, yes, because the numbers mean the underperforming minority students are being woefully ill served by the K-12 school system. Moreover, arriving at institutions of higher education with an academic disadvantage, they do not catch up, as it has become clear. ",

There had been some talk of going to the opera afterwards, but no one seemed to care about it, and so it dropped through. \n\n\"For my part,\" Lady Thurwell said, as they sat lingering over their dessert, \"I shall quite enjoy an evening's rest. You literary men, Mr. Maddison, talk a good deal about being overworked, but you know nothing of the life of a chaperon in the season. I tell Helen that she is sadly wanting in gratitude. We do everything worth doing--picture galleries, matin\u00e9es, shopping, afternoon calls, dinners, dances, receptions--why, there's no slavery like it.\" \n\nHelen laughed softly. \n\n\"We do a great deal too much, aunt,\" she said. \"I am almost coming round to my father's opinion. You know, Mr. Maddison, he very seldom comes to London, and then only when he wants to pay a visit to his gunmaker, or to renew his hunting kit, or something of that sort. London life does not suit him at all.\" \n\n\"I think your father a very wise man,\" he answered. \"He seeks his pleasures in a more wholesome manner.\" \n\nShe looked thoughtful. \n\n\"Yes, I suppose, ethically, the life of a man about town is on a very low level. That is why one meets so few who interest one, as a rule. Don't you think all this society life very frivolous, Mr. Maddison?\" \n\n\"I am not willing to be its judge,\" he answered. \"Yet it is a moral axiom that the higher we seek for our pleasures the greater happiness we attain to. I am an uncompromising enemy to what is known as fashionable society, so I will draw no conclusions.\" ",

And basically, you know, call it the stupidity of the American voter or whatever. But basically that was really, really critical to getting the thing to pass.\" ",

Beautiful to watch her as she arranged their forms and composed their groups; to mark her eye glance with gratification at some happy combination of colour, or to listen to her delight as they wafted to her in gratitude their perfume. Oswald and Sir Joseph were surveying the stables; Mr. Millbank, who had been daily expected for the last week from the factories, had not yet arrived. \n\n'I must say he gained my heart from the first,' said Lady Wallinger. \n\n'I wish the gardener would send us more roses,' said Edith. \n\n'He is so very superior to any young man I ever met,' continued Lady Wallinger. \n\n'I think we must have this vase entirely of roses; don't you think so, aunt?' inquired her niece. \n\n'I am fond of roses,' said Lady Wallinger.

        "meta": "PITTSBURGH - For most people, snakes seem unpleasant or even threatening. But Howie Choset sees in their delicate movements a way to save lives. \n\nThe 37-year-old Carnegie Mellon University professor has spent years developing snake-like robots he hopes will eventually slide through fallen buildings in search of victims trapped after natural disasters or other emergencies. \n\nDan Kara is president of Robotics Trends, a Northboro, Mass.-based company that publishes an online industry magazine and runs robotics trade shows. He said there are other snake-like robots being developed, mainly at universities, but didn't know of one that could climb pipes. \n\nThe Carnegie Mellon machines are designed to carry cameras and electronic sensors and can be controlled with a joystick . They move smoothly with the help of small electric motors, or servos, commonly used by hobbyists in model airplanes. \n\nBuilt from lightweight materials, the robots are about the size of a human arm or smaller. They can sense which way is up, but are only as good as their human operators, Choset added. \n\nSam Stover, a search term manager with the Federal Emergency Management Agency based in Indiana, said snake-type robots would offer greater mobility than equipment currently available, such as cameras attached to extendable roles. \n\n\"It just allows us to do something we've not been able to do before,\" Stover said, \"We needed them yesterday.\" \n\nHe said snifter dogs are still the best search tool for rescue workers, but that they can only be used effectively when workers have access to damaged building. \n\nStover, among the rescue workers who handled the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, said snake robots would have helped rescuers search flooded houses in that disaster. \n\nChoset said the robots may not be ready for use for another five to ten years, depending on funding.",

There he found his neighbor Ashley, who was also an evil superhero. John thought she was an evil superhero at least. When John got to the bus stop, Ashley made a silly face at him. Then she dared him to lick a worm she found on the sidewalk. John had super powers, so he said yes to the dare. He picked up the worm. It was slimy and gross. It wiggled around between his fingers. John closed his eyes and licked it. Ashley laughed so hard, she fell to the ground. But John felt like a real superhero who had won the day for good kids everywhere. First thing tomorrow, John would start wearing a cape to school. He hoped his mommy would let him wear it. The bus came and Ashley was still sitting on the ground laughing. John had a great, superhero kind of thought. He put the worm in her hair. Now Ashley was screaming! John the superhero got in trouble for that.",

He moves around her office at work and goes shopping with her. \"Most people don't seem to mind Tom,\" says Catherine, who thinks he is wonderful. \"He's my fourth child,\" she says. She may think of him and treat him that way as her son. He moves around buying his food, paying his health bills and his taxes, but in fact Tom is a dog. \n\nCatherine and Tom live in Sweden, a country where everyone is expected to lead an orderly life according to rules laid down by the government, which also provides a high level of care for its people. This level of care costs money. \n\nPeople in Sweden pay taxes on everything, so aren't surprised to find that owning a dog means more taxes. Some people are paying as much as 500 Swedish kronor in taxes a year for the right to keep their dog, which is spent by the government on dog hospitals and sometimes medical treatment for a dog that falls ill. However, most such treatment is expensive, so owners often decide to offer health and even life _ for their dog. \n\nIn Sweden dog owners must pay for any damage their dog does. A Swedish Kennel Club official explains what this means: if your dog runs out on the road and gets hit by a passing car, you, as the owner, have to pay for any damage done to the car, even if your dog has been killed in the accident.",

        "meta": "ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- In 1989, the warnings were dire. The Spike Lee film \"Do the Right Thing,\" critics and columnists said, would provoke violence and disrupt race relations. \n\nSpike Lee: \"I wanted to do a film that would try to show what was happening at the time.\" \n\n\"This movie is dynamite under every seat,\" wrote Newsweek's Jack Kroll. \n\nOther commentators believed the film would harm the candidacy of David Dinkins, an African-American who was running for mayor of New York. It might even spark riots at movie theaters, they thought. \n\nInstead, what the film provoked was ... talk. There were no riots. Dinkins was elected. \"Do the Right Thing\" had a successful run at the box office -- if not as successful as Lee and his supporters hoped -- and was nominated for two Academy Awards. \n\nTwenty years later, the film still maintains a hold on the imagination. In 2007, the American Film Institute ranked it as one of the 100 best American films. Roger Ebert, who has written he cried when he first saw the film at the Cannes Film Festival, still considers the film a wonder: \"Spike Lee had done an almost impossible thing. He'd made a movie about race in America that empathized with all the participants,\" he wrote in 2001. \n\nSo what is the thing about \"Do the Right Thing?\" Watch Spike Lee describe things in his own words \u00bb \n\nPart of its staying power is in its boldness, both in look and action. Lee's first two films, \"She's Gotta Have It\" (1986) and \"School Daze\" (1988), had marked him as a rising young filmmaker. But it was \"Do the Right Thing,\" made when Lee was just 32, that showcased his confidence, from the deliberately striking color scheme (bright reds and oranges that make a hot day seem even hotter) to its heightened -- sometimes stagy -- atmosphere, to its grim, documentary-style riot climax.

THE VELVET COACH \n\n\n\nNo, my good Lord, Diana-- ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL \n\nA late autumn journey from the west coast to Paris was a more serious undertaking in the sixteenth century than the good seaman Master Hobbs was aware of, or he would have used stronger dissuasive measures against such an undertaking by the two youths, when the elder was in so frail a state of health; but there had been a certain deceptive strength and vigour about young Ribaumont while under strong excitement and determination, and the whole party fancied him far fitter to meet the hardships than was really the case. Philip Thistlewood always recollected that journey as the most distressing period of his life. \n\nThey were out of the ordinary highways, and therefore found the hiring of horses often extremely difficult. They had intended to purchase, but found no animals that, as Philip said, they would have accepted as a gift, though at every wretched inn where they had to wait while the country was scoured for the miserable jades, their proposed requirements fell lower and lower. Dens of smoke, dirt, and boorishness were the great proportion of those inns, where they were compelled to take refuge by the breaking down of one or other of the beasts, or by stress of weather. Snow, rain, thaw and frost alternated, each variety rendering the roads impassable; and at the best, the beasts could seldom be urged beyond a walk, fetlock-deep in mire or water. Worse than all, Berenger, far from recovered, and under the heavy oppression of a heartrending grief, could hardly fail to lose the ground that he had gained under the influence of hope. The cold seemed to fix itself on the wound on his cheek, terrible pain and swelling set in, depriving him entirely of sleep, permitting him to take no nourishment but fragments of soft crumbs soaked in wine or broth--when the inns afforded any such fare--and rendering speech excessively painful, and at last unintelligible.

It began, \"My dear Willie.\" He was very happy. Now over 50, he didn't think someone would call him \"Willie\". Here is that letter. My dear Willie, I can't tell you how much your letter meant to me. I am in my eighties, living alone in a small room and cooking my own meals. You will be interested to know that I taught school for 50 years and yours is the first letter of appreciation I ever got. It came on a cold morning and it made me feel very warm. ... William cried when he read the letter. She was one of the people that William hadn't thanked in his past. She helped him to believe in himself. He would never forget her. There are some people we should always remember, because they helped to shape our life. William Stidger found a way to show his appreciation--he wrote them letters.

Louisiana is the only state in the U.S. with political subdivisions termed parishes, which are the local government's equivalent to counties. The largest parish by population is East Baton Rouge Parish, and the largest by total area is Plaquemines. Louisiana is bordered by Arkansas to the north, Mississippi to the east, Texas to the west, and the Gulf of Mexico to the south. \n\nMuch of the state's lands were formed from sediment washed down the Mississippi River, leaving enormous deltas and vast areas of coastal marsh and swamp. These contain a rich southern biota; typical examples include birds such as ibis and egrets. There are also many species of tree frogs, and fish such as sturgeon and paddlefish. In more elevated areas, fire is a natural process in the landscape, and has produced extensive areas of longleaf pine forest and wet savannas. These support an exceptionally large number of plant species, including many species of orchids and carnivorous plants. Louisiana has more Native American tribes than any other southern state, including four that are federally recognized, ten that are state recognized, and four that have not yet received recognition.",

        "meta": "Climate is the statistics of weather over long periods of time. It is measured by assessing the patterns of variation in temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, wind, precipitation, atmospheric particle count and other meteorological variables in a given region over long periods of time. Climate differs from weather, in that weather only describes the short-term conditions of these variables in a given region. \n\nA region's climate is generated by the climate system, which has five components: atmosphere, hydrosphere, cryosphere, lithosphere, and biosphere. \n\nThe climate of a location is affected by its latitude, terrain, and altitude, as well as nearby water bodies and their currents. Climates can be classified according to the average and the typical ranges of different variables, most commonly temperature and precipitation. The most commonly used classification scheme was the K\u00f6ppen climate classification. The Thornthwaite system, in use since 1948, incorporates evapotranspiration along with temperature and precipitation information and is used in studying biological diversity and how climate change affects it. The Bergeron and Spatial Synoptic Classification systems focus on the origin of air masses that define the climate of a region. \n\nPaleoclimatology is the study of ancient climates. Since direct observations of climate are not available before the 19th century, paleoclimates are inferred from proxy variables that include non-biotic evidence such as sediments found in lake beds and ice cores, and biotic evidence such as tree rings and coral. Climate models are mathematical models of past, present and future climates. Climate change may occur over long and short timescales from a variety of factors; recent warming is discussed in global warming. Global warming results in redistributions. For example, \"a 3\u00b0C change in mean annual temperature corresponds to a shift in isotherms of approximately 300\u2013400 km in latitude (in the temperate zone) or 500 m in elevation. Therefore, species are expected to move upwards in elevation or towards the poles in latitude in response to shifting climate zones\".",

Some genetic traits are instantly visible, such as eye colour or number of limbs, and some are not, such as blood type, risk for specific diseases, or the thousands of basic biochemical processes that comprise life. \n\nGenes can acquire mutations in their sequence, leading to different variants, known as alleles, in the population. These alleles encode slightly different versions of a protein, which cause different phenotype traits. Colloquial usage of the term \"having a gene\" (e.g., \"good genes,\" \"hair colour gene\") typically refers to having a different allele of the gene.

It was really a very good newspaper, if small in size, and related the news of the day as promptly as the great New York journals did. \n\nArthur Weldon had not been very enthusiastic about the paper at any time, although he humored the girls by attending in a good-natured way to the advertising, hiring some of the country folk to get subscriptions, and keeping the books. He was a young man of considerable education who had inherited a large fortune, safely invested, and therefore had no need, through financial necessity, to interest himself in business of any sort. He allowed the girls to print his name as editor in chief, but he did no editorial work at all, amusing himself these delightful summer days by wandering in the woods, where he collected botanical specimens, or sitting with Uncle John on the lawn, where they read together or played chess. Both the men were glad the girls were happy in their work and enthusiastic over the success of their audacious venture. Beth was developing decided talent as a writer of editorials and her articles were even more thoughtful and dignified than were those of Patsy. The two girls found plenty to occupy them at the office, while Louise did the reportorial work and flitted through Millville and down to Huntingdon each day in search of small items of local interest. She grew fond of this work, for it brought her close to the people and enabled her to study their characters and peculiarities. Her manner of approaching the simple country folk was so gracious and winning that they freely gave her any information they possessed, and chatted with her unreservedly. ",

The order's chapel is the Savoy Chapel in London. \n\nThere are no limits on the number honoured, and admission remains at the sole discretion of the monarch, with each of the order's five grades and one medal with three levels representing different levels of service. While all those honoured may use the prescribed styles of the order\u2014the top two grades grant titles of knighthood, and all grades accord distinct post-nominal letters\u2014the Royal Victorian Order's precedence amongst other honours differs from realm to realm and admission to some grades may be barred to citizens of those realms by government policy. \n\nPrior to the close of the 19th century, most general honours within the British Empire were bestowed by the sovereign on the advice of her British ministers, who sometimes forwarded advice from ministers of the Crown in the Dominions and colonies (appointments to the then most senior orders of chivalry\u2014the Most Noble Order of the Garter and the Most Ancient and Most Noble Order of the Thistle\u2014had been made on ministerial advice since the 18th century and were not restored to the personal gift of the sovereign until 1946 and 1947, respectively). Queen Victoria thus established on 21 April 1896 the Royal Victorian Order as a junior and personal order of knighthood that allowed her to bestow directly to an empire-wide community honours for personal services. The organisation was founded a year preceding Victoria's Diamond Jubilee, so as to give the Queen time to complete a list of first inductees. The order's official day was made 20 June of each year, marking the anniversary of Queen Victoria's accession to the throne.",

Her desire to get away from that gem of the sea, helped to rally her strength and courage. For what place, though it were the flowery vale of Enna, may not the inward sense turn into a circle of punishment where the flowers are no better than a crop of flame-tongues burning the soles of our feet? \n\n\"I shall never like to see the Mediterranean again,\" said Gwendolen, to her mother, who thought that she quite understood her child's feeling--even in her tacit prohibition of any express reference to her late husband. \n\nMrs. Davilow, indeed, though compelled formally to regard this time as one of severe calamity, was virtually enjoying her life more than she had ever done since her daughter's marriage. It seemed that her darling was brought back to her not merely with all the old affection, but with a conscious cherishing of her mother's nearness, such as we give to a possession that we have been on the brink of losing. \n\n\"Are you there, mamma?\" cried Gwendolen, in the middle of the night (a bed had been made for her mother in the same room with hers), very much as she would have done in her early girlhood, if she had felt frightened in lying awake.

A source at SeaWorld said that after seizing her, the whale dove deep underwater. Trainers eventually had to wrangle the animal into a smaller pool before they could retrieve her body about 40 minutes later. \n\nWESH: Watch tourist's video just before attack \n\nA former head of animal training said Friday that Brancheau left herself vulnerable to attack and that she may have broken the park's training protocol. \n\n\"Dawn, if she was standing here right now, would tell you that that was her mistake in allowing that to happen,\" said former SeaWorld trainer Thad Lacinak, who had worked with Brancheau in the past, on ABC's \"Good Morning America.\" \n\nLacinak called Brancheau \"one the best killer whale trainers I ever worked with.\" \n\nStill, he said, Brancheau should not have been lying in a slideout -- a platform covered by roughly 4 inches of water -- so close to a killer whale.

His prospects of success, in pleading for a favorable reception of his brother's message, were so uncertain that he refrained--in fear of raising hopes which he might not be able to justify--from taking Herbert into his confidence. No one knew on what errand he was bent, when he left the house. As he took his place in the carriage, the newspaper boy appeared at the window as usual. The new number of a popular weekly journal had that day been published. Randal bought it. \n\nAfter reading one or two of the political articles, he arrived at the columns specially devoted to \"Fashionable Intelligence.\" Caring nothing for that sort of news, he was turning over the pages in search of the literary and dramatic articles, when a name not unfamiliar to him caught his eye. He read the paragraph in which it appeared. \n\n\"The charming widow, Mrs. Norman, is, we hear, among the distinguished guests staying at Buck's Hotel. It is whispered that the lady is to be shortly united to a retired naval officer of Arctic fame; now better known, perhaps, as one of our leading philanthropists.\" \n\nThe allusion to Bennydeck was too plain to be mistaken. Randal looked again at the first words in the paragraph. \"The charming widow!\" Was it possible that this last word referred to Catherine? To suppose her capable of assuming to be a widow, and--if the child asked questions--of telling Kitty that her father was dead, was, in Randal's estimation, to wrong her cruelly. With his own suspicions steadily contradicting him, he arrived at the hotel, obstinately believing that \"the charming widow\" would prove to be a stranger. ",

He was watching three TV shows that night. First, was Muffins the Cat. The second show was Ernie the Talking Donkey. The third was Laughing with Herman Hamster. His Mom told him to go to bed, but Douglas didn't listen. He fell asleep on the couch. He dreamed all night. First about sheep jumping fences. Second about playing fetch the ball with Ruffles. Third about Ernie the talking Donkey kicking a soccer ball over the moon. Fourth about his favorite soccer player, Pele, head the ball in the goal. \n\nFinally, the next morning, Douglas got up late because he was so tired. His Mom called him and the alarm went off, but he did not hear. To get Douglas up, his Mom got Ruffles the dog to lick him in the face. Douglas got up but had to eat breakfast fast. Then he quickly dressed into his uniform. He was yawning. \n\nHis Mom drove him to the soccer field. The game had started. Douglas had to sit out the first quarter. His team was losing one to nothing when Howard scored for the Lions. Douglas started the second quarter. He was tired and could not keep up with the rest of his team. The coach was surprised that Douglas was so slow. Usually he was fast. After the second quarter, the Dolphins were losing two to one after Howard scored again for the Lions and Toby scored a goal for the Dolphins. While the coach gave energy drinks to the team, Douglas fell asleep. The third quarter started. \n\nDouglas was snoring when the coach told him to go in. When he saw Douglas was sleeping, he sent Billy into the game. Billy scored one goal and the Dolphins had tied the game two to two. Ruffles the dog started barking and then licking Douglas in the face. Douglas got up and stretched. He was finally well rested. The coach saw Douglas and sent him into the game. Douglas remembered his dream. In the last second, he headed the ball in the goal like Pele. He won the game. The team cheered. \n\nSince that time, Douglas goes to bed on time. He always wants to be well rested. His Mom was right. He gave her a hug.",

Next, she took the clothes out of the washer and put them into the drier. She pressed the button on the drier to get it started then walked back out of the room. She also needed to feed her duck. The chickens in her backyard did not need to be fed as they belonged to her neighbor. Jack the dog had been fed earlier that morning and Becky the cat always had food in her bowl. After Jessica finished feeding the duck she came inside and heard the telephone ringing. She answered the phone to hear Annie's excited voice say \"Happy birthday grandma!\" Annie said they would be over very soon. Jessica smiled because she loved her family more than anything.

He looked along the road, but there were no blue flowers. He looked by the stream, but there were no blue flowers. He was very sad.

As they neared their home, John saw a small bunch of blue flowers growing near the fence. He was so happy he picked them all and rushed to catch up with his brother and sisters.

They had inquired of a fellow-passenger, who seemed acquainted with the country, and were told that there was a very good tavern about a quarter of a mile from the mill. \n\nWhen they landed upon the logs, Marco, whose curiosity seemed to be stronger than his appetite, wanted to ramble about for a little time along the shore and among the piles of boards, but Forester thought it would be best first to go and get their breakfast. \n\n\"Because,\" said he, \"we can then amuse ourselves by rambling about here, and shall be ready to return to the steamboat whenever they send for us.\" \n\nSo they went to the tavern. \n\nForester seemed to have little appetite for his breakfast. He complained of feeling fatigued, and yet he had nothing to fatigue him. Marco ate, and talked fast all the time; but Forester seemed silent and dejected. \n\n\"Come, cousin Forester, what is the matter with you?\" said Marco at last. \n\nForester said that he felt somewhat unwell, and as there was a sofa in the room, he concluded to lie down upon it, and not go out. Marco was, at first, disposed to stay and take care of him, but Forester said that he did not need anything, and he wished Marco to go out and amuse himself. \n\n\"You may go and see the mill,\" said he, \"and the logs along the shore; only be careful not to go where there is any danger; and come and let me know when the boat is coming from the steamer to take us on board again.\" ",

        "meta": "George Zimmerman, set to stand trial in the 2012 shooting death of teenager Trayvon Martin, on Tuesday waived his right to a \"stand your ground\" pretrial immunity hearing. Zimmerman's attorneys have decided they will try this as a self-defense case. \n\nFlorida's deadly force law, also called \"stand your ground\", was passed in 2005. It allows people to meet \"force with force\" if they believe they or someone else is in danger of being seriously harmed by an assailant. Under the law, a person can use deadly force anywhere as long as he is not engaged in an unlawful activity, is being attacked in a place he has a right to be, and reasonably believes that his life and safety are in danger as a result of an overt act or perceived threat committed by someone else. \n\nIn a pretrial immunity hearing, a judge would have ruled whether Zimmerman's actions were protected under the \"stand your ground\" law; a ruling in favor of the defendant would have meant that no criminal or civil trial could proceed. \n\nMartin was shot and killed on February 26, 2012, while returning from a nearby convenience store to his father's fianc\u00e9e's house in a gated community in Sanford, Florida. \n\nZimmerman, a neighborhood watch captain, acknowledged that he shot the unarmed 17-year-old, but said Martin physically attacked him and he fired in self-defense. Initially, no charges were pursued, and the case soon became the center of a national controversy. \n\nZimmerman was charged with second-degree murder on April 11, 2012. ",

It was started in 1908 by Mary Baker Eddy, the founder of the Church of Christ, Scientist. , the print circulation was 75,052. \n\nThe \"Monitor\" is a newspaper that covers international and United States current events. The paper includes a daily religious feature on \"The Home Forum\" page, but states the publication is not a platform for evangelizing. \n\nIn 2008 the \"Monitor\" discontinued its daily print version to focus on web-based publishing, replacing its daily print edition with a weekly news magazine with an international focus. Mark Sappenfield became the editor in March of 2017. \n\nDespite its name, the \"Monitor\" does not claim to be a religious-themed paper, and says it does not promote the doctrine of its patron church. However, at its founder Eddy's request, a daily religious article has appeared in every issue of the \"Monitor\". Eddy also required the inclusion of \"Christian Science\" in the paper's name, over initial opposition by some of her advisors who thought the religious reference might repel a secular audience. \n\nThe \"Monitor\"'s inception was, in part, a response by Eddy to the journalism of her day, which relentlessly covered the sensations and scandals surrounding her new religion with varying degrees of accuracy. In addition, Joseph Pulitzer's \"New York World\" was consistently critical of Eddy, and this, along with a derogatory article in \"McClure's\", furthered Eddy's decision to found her own media outlet.",

Cork achieved an urban character at some point between 915 and 922 when Norseman (Viking) settlers founded a trading port. It has been proposed that, like Dublin, Cork was an important trading centre in the global Scandinavian trade network. The ecclesiastical settlement continued alongside the Viking longphort, with the two developing a type of symbiotic relationship; the Norsemen providing otherwise unobtainable trade goods for the monastery, and perhaps also military aid. \n\nThe city's charter was granted by Prince John, as Lord of Ireland, in 1185. The city was once fully walled, and some wall sections and gates remain today. For much of the Middle Ages, Cork city was an outpost of Old English culture in the midst of a predominantly hostile Gaelic countryside and cut off from the English government in the Pale around Dublin. Neighbouring Gaelic and Hiberno-Norman lords extorted \"Black Rent\" from the citizens to keep them from attacking the city. The present extent of the city has exceeded the medieval boundaries of the Barony of Cork City; it now takes in much of the neighbouring Barony of Cork. Together, these baronies are located between the Barony of Barrymore to the east, Muskerry East to the west and Kerrycurrihy to the south.",

In his free time, he would make drawings about how much he wished he could fly. He would look up at the stars in wonder, hoping that some day, his dream might come true. For many years, his life carried on this way. He would wake up on the farm, go to work, and then come home to dream about flying. That is, until one day, he got a letter with a strange sticker on it, that was shaped like a star. He opened the letter in excitement, wondering what it said. The letter said that Oink was invited to a special party that took place every year in the clouds. Animals from all across the world were chosen so that they could know what it's like to fly. If he chose to go to the party, he would get his own set of wings to fly up into the sky and meet the other animals. Oink was so happy, he barely knew how to react. He accepted the invitation, and two days later, got a package containing his wings. Oink's dream was finally coming true. He put the wings on his back and flew up into the sky, where the party was being held. Once he arrived, he saw a bunch of other animals with wings also. He saw horses, dogs, cats, and plenty of birds. Oink had found out that it was the birds who had invited everyone, since they wanted the other animals to know what it is like to fly. Oink spent that day flying in the clouds with his new friends. But when the clock reached midnight, he knew his time flying was up, and he had to return the wings and go back to his farm. But the birds told him that they saw how much he enjoyed flying, and would allow him to keep his wings so he could fly with them whenever he wanted. Oink was really thankful, and next time he saw the birds, gave them their own pair of shoes for free as a thank you gift.",

        "meta": "Sydney (CNN) -- Kevin Rudd and Tony Abbott, the two men vying to be Australia's prime minister in the September 7 national election, offer contrasting views on China, the country that looms largest on Australia's economic and strategic horizon. \n\nRudd, the Chinese-speaking incumbent prime minister in the Labor-led government, says the China resources boom is over and Australia needs to prepare for that transition, given how important China has become as a trade partner in the past decade. \n\nChina is a key destination for Australian resources such as iron ore, coal and LNG. But in recent months, even China's breakneck economic pace has hit some speed bumps. \n\nOn the broader geopolitical front, Rudd wants China and the United States to carve out a new Asia-Pacific \"strategic road-map\" that will enhance trade, investment and security in the region. \n\nREAD MORE: Rudd: Better second time around? \n\nThe Opposition's view on China \n\nAbbott, who has led the opposition Liberal Party since 2009, wants the Australia-China relationship to move from one based on shared interests to one of \"shared values.\" \n\nBut he notes that Australia's friendship with China is more recent than that with Japan, and less developed than that with the United States. \n\nIn a major policy speech to a business audience in Beijing last year, Abbott said he believed it would take time before Australia's ties with China approached \"the warmth that we take for granted with America.\" Still, he believes it is an effort worth making. \n\nLike his mentor, former Australian prime minister John Howard, Abbott is a rock-solid supporter of Australia's military alliance with the United States, and believes that it is possible to be friends both with Washington and Beijing. Howard, he said, \"understood that you could make a new friend without losing an old one.\" ",

Gertie is the kind of dog that has to grow on you. So I dicided that the dog would be trained. This didn't quite go as planned. At 15 weeks old, she was nearly made to leave the Petsmart Training School. She spent every night lying in our bed-snoring so loudly that I hardly got a good night's sleep. Then, about six months after she arrived, I felt that something in my heart was taking place, and I was unable to stop it. My behaviour began to change. I began to smile at people when passing them in a street. I returned from neighbours. I started calling my kids, and to my surprise, they started calling me. I even tried to speak to my grandchildren over the phone once. I even was glad to listen to laughter from a 10-month-old granddaughter. The point is that I was changing. My wife and I both agree that it is Gertie who has changed my behaviour.

        "meta": "A social class (or, simply, class), as in class society, is a set of subjectively defined concepts in the social sciences and political theory centered on models of social stratification in which people are grouped into a set of hierarchical social categories, the most common being the upper, middle, and lower classes. \n\nClass is a subject of analysis for sociologists, political scientists, anthropologists, and social historians. However, there is not a consensus on a definition of \"class\", and the term has a wide range of sometimes conflicting meanings. In common parlance, the term \"social class\" is usually synonymous with \"socio-economic class\", defined as \"people having the same social, economic, cultural, political or educational status\", e.g., \"the working class\"; \"an emerging professional class\". However, academics distinguish social class and socioeconomic status, with the former referring to one\u2019s relatively stable sociocultural background and the latter referring to one\u2019s current social and economic situation and, consequently, being more changeable over time. \n\nThe precise measurements of what determines social class in society has varied over time. Karl Marx thought \"class\" was defined by one's relationship to the means of production (their relations of production). His simple understanding of classes in modern capitalist society, are the proletariat, those who work but do not own the means of production; and the bourgeoisie, those who invest and live off of the surplus generated by the former. This contrasts with the view of the sociologist Max Weber, who argued \"class\" is determined by economic position, in contrast to \"social status\" or \"\"Stand\"\" which is determined by social prestige rather than simply just relations of production.",

Bush last year arrived in Syria on Tuesday night, hours after being released from prison, his employer said. \n\nMuntadhar al-Zaidi speaks to reporters shorlty after his release from an Iraqi jail. \n\nAl-Baghdadia TV said Muntadhar al-Zaidi had arrived in Damascus. \n\nAl-Zaidi's brother, Dhirgham al-Zaidi, told CNN that the 30-year-old journalist was to travel in a private plane to Greece for medical treatment. \n\nShortly after he left prison, the 30-year-old journalist visited the studios of his employer, Al-Baghdadia TV, where he spoke to other reporters about his experience. He wore a sash in the colors of the Iraqi national flag draped around his shoulders. \n\nMuntadhar al-Zaidi said he was beaten with cables and pipes and tortured with electricity immediately after guards removed him from a news conference for hurling both shoes at Bush. He said he was taken into another room and beaten even as the news conference continued. \n\nHowever, he remained defiant about the incident that landed him in prison. \n\n\"I got my chance, and I didn't miss it,\" he said. \n\n\"I am not a hero, and I admit that,\" he added. \"I am a person with a stance. I saw my country burning.\" \n\nAl-Zaidi, who was serving a one-year sentence after the jail-throwing incident December 14, was given a \"conditional discharge.\" \n\nUnder Iraqi law, a \"conditional discharge\" allows for the release of a prisoner after he serves three-quarters of his sentence, on good behavior.

Bob's family never knew about Peter, and Peter's family never knew about Bob. Soon Bob and Peter's story appeared in the newspaper. There was a photo of Bob and Peter next to the story.

But this year, the most coveted ticket was Friday night's \"2013 MusiCares Person of the Year Tribute\" honoring Bruce Springsteen. \n\nThe evening's entertainment featured six Rock and Roll Hall of Famers, a few critically acclaimed young artists -- and The Boss himself. \n\nNeil Young and Crazy Horse turned up the volume with a spirited version of \"Born in the U.S.A,\" flanked by a pair of cheerleaders with the letter \"S\" emblazoned on their sweaters. Colombian superstar Juanes put a bilingual spin on \"Hungry Heart,\" singing verses in both Spanish and English, and John Legend transformed \"Dancing in the Dark\" into a jazzy piano ballad, which led Springsteen to later remark that \"he made me sound like Gershwin. I love that.\" \n\nOther standout performances included Mumford & Sons' banjo-laced cover of \"I'm on Fire,\" Tom Morello and Jim James' mesmerizing take on \"The Ghost of Tom Joad,\" and country superstar Kenny Chesney's quietly effective rendition of \"One Step Up.\" \n\nElton John also opted for simplicity, accompanied only by his piano on \"Streets of Philadelphia.\" But the most curious vocal of the night was on \"Lonesome Day,\" where Sting exhibited a raspy growl that suggested he was looking to honor Springsteen by sounding like him. \n\nThe evening was part all-star concert, part fundraiser to benefit the MusiCares Foundation, the Recording Academy's philanthropic arm that provides assistance to members of the music industry.

The blast also wounded two others, IRNA said. \n\nState television channel Press TV reported later Wednesday that Roshan's driver, Reza Qashqaei, had died in a hospital from his injuries. \n\nMohammad Khazaee, Iranian ambassador to the United Nations, condemned what he called \"cruel, inhumane and criminal acts of terrorism against the Iranian scientists.\" \n\n\"Based on the existing evidence collected by the relevant Iranian security authorities, similar to previous incidents, perpetrators used the same terrorist method in assassinating Iranian nuclear scientists, i.e., attaching a sticky magnetic bomb to the car carrying the scientists and detonating it,\" Khazaee said in a statement. \n\n\"I would like to emphasize, once again, that the Islamic Republic (of) Iran would not compromise over its inalienable right to use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes and any kind of political and economic pressures or terrorist attacks targeting the Iranian nuclear scientists, could not prevent our nation in exercising this right,\" Khazaee said. \n\nLawmaker Kazem Jalali blamed the intelligence agencies of the United States and Israel for the latest attack, saying the United Nations' nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, also bore responsibility for passing on information about Iran's nuclear scientists to other countries, IRNA reports.

Then the people began to whisper excitedly to one another. \n\n\"Shall this be done before our eyes?\" said Arnold of Melchthal to Werner Stauffacher. \"Of what use was it that we swore an oath to rebel if we permit this? Let us rise and slay the tyrant.\" \n\nWerner Stauffacher, prudent man, scratched his chin thoughtfully. \n\n\"We-e-ll,\" he said, \"you see, the difficulty is that we are not armed and the soldiers _are_. There is nothing I should enjoy more than slaying the tyrant, only I have an idea that the tyrant would slay us. You see my point?\" \n\n\"Why were we so slow!\" groaned Arnold. \"We should have risen before, and then this would never have happened. Who was it that advised us to delay?\" \n\n\"We-e-ll,\" said Stauffacher (who had himself advised delay), \"I can't quite remember at the moment, but I dare say you could find out by looking up the minutes of our last meeting. I know the motion was carried by a majority of two votes. See! Gessler grows impatient.\" \n\nGessler, who had been fidgeting on his horse for some time, now spoke again, urging Tell to hurry. \n\n\"Begin!\" he cried--\"begin!\" \n\n\"Immediately,\" replied Tell, fitting the arrow to the string. \n\nGessler began to mock him once more. \n\n\"You see now,\" he said, \"the danger of carrying arms. I don't know if you have ever noticed it, but arrows very often recoil on the man who carries them. The only man who has any business to possess a weapon is the ruler of a country--myself, for instance. A low, common fellow--if you will excuse the description--like yourself only grows proud through being armed, and so offends those above him. But, of course, it's no business of mine. I am only telling you what I think about it. Personally, I like to encourage my subjects to shoot; that is why I am giving you such a splendid mark to shoot at. You see, Tell?\" ",

        "meta": "Argentina is subdivided into twenty-three provinces (, singular \"provincia\") and one autonomous city (\"ciudad aut\u00f3noma\"), Buenos Aires, which is the federal capital of the nation () as decided by Congress. The provinces and the capital have their own constitutions, but exist under a federal system. \n\nDuring the War of Independence the main cities and their surrounding countrysides became provinces though the intervention of their \"cabildos\". The Anarchy of the Year XX completed this process, shaping the original thirteen provinces. Jujuy seceded from Salta in 1834, and the thirteen provinces became fourteen. After seceding for a decade, Buenos Aires Province accepted the 1853 Constitution of Argentina in 1861, and its capital city was made a federal territory in 1880. \n\nA law from 1862 designated as national territories those under federal control but outside the frontiers of the provinces. In 1884 they served as bases for the establishment of the governorates of Misiones, Formosa, Chaco, La Pampa, Neuqu\u00e9n, R\u00edo Negro, Chubut, Santa Cruz and Tierra del Fuego. The agreement about a frontier dispute with Chile in 1900 created the National Territory of Los Andes; its lands were incorporated into Jujuy, Salta and Catamarca in 1943. La Pampa and Chaco became provinces in 1951. Misiones did so in 1953, and Formosa, Neuqu\u00e9n, R\u00edo Negro, Chubut and Santa Cruz, in 1955. The last national territory, Tierra del Fuego, became the Tierra del Fuego, Ant\u00e1rtida e Islas del Atl\u00e1ntico Sur Province in 1990.",

        "meta": "Steven Spielberg was not a scholar, and his classmates teased him. Rather than read, the kid really preferred running around with an 8mm camera, shooting homemade movies, which he showed to friends for a small fee. \n\nIn his first year of high school, he dropped out. But when his parents persuaded him to return, he was mistakenly placed in a learningdisabled class, which lasted one month. Only when the family moved to another town did he land up in a more suitable high school, where he eventually graduated. \n\nAfter being denied entrance into a traditional filmmaking school, Steven Spielherg enrolled in English at California State University at Long Beach. Then in 1965, he recalls, in one of those serendipitous moments, his life took a complete turn. Visiting Universal Studios, he met Chuck Silvers, an executive in the editorial department. Silvers liked the kid who made 8mm films and invited him back sometime to visit. \n\nHe appeared the next day. Spielberg, dressed in a dark suit, carrying his father's briefcase with nothing inside but a sandwich and candy bars walked confidently up to the guard at the gate of Universal and gave him a casual wave. The guard waved back. He was in. \n\n\"For the entire summer,\" Spielberg remembers, \"I dressed in my suit and hung out with the directors and writers, including Silvers, who knew the kid wasn't a studio employee, but winked at him. I even found an office that wasn't being used, and became a squatter . I bought some plastic tiles and put my name in the building directory: Steven Spielberg, Room 23C.\" \n\nIt paid off for everyone. Ten years later, the 28yearold Spielberg directed Jaws, which took in $470 million, then the biggest grossing movie of all time. Dozens of films and awards have followed because Steven Spielberg knew what his teachers didn't--talent is in the eyes of the filmmaker.",

        "meta": "Most people know precious gemstones by their appearances. An emerald flashes deep green, a ruby seems to hold a red fire inside, and a diamond shines like a star. It's more difficult to tell where the gem was mined, since a diamond from Australia or Arkansas may appear the same to one from the Democratic Republic of the Congo. However, recently, a team of scientists has found a way to identify a gemstone's origin. \n\nBeneath the surface of a gemstone, on the tiny level of atoms and molecules , lie clues to its origin. At this year's meeting of the Geological Society of America in Minneapolis, Catherine McManus reported on a technique that uses lasers to clarify these clues and identify a stone's homeland. McManus directs scientific research at Materialytics, in Killeen, Texas. The company is developing the technique. \"With enough data, we could identify which country, which mining place, even the individual mine a gemstone comes from,\" McManus told Science News. \n\nSome gemstones, including many diamonds, come from war-torn countries. Sales of those \"blood minerals\" may encourage violent civil wars where innocent people are injured or killed. In an effort to reduce the trade in blood minerals, the U.S. government passed law in July 2010 that requires companies that sell gemstones to determine the origins of their stones. \n\nTo figure out where gemstones come from, McManus and her team focus a powerful laser on a small sample of the gemstone. The technique is called laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy. Just as heat can turn ice into water or water into steam, energy from the laser changes the state of matter of the stone. The laser changes a miniscule part of the gemstone into plasma, a gas state of matter in which tiny particles called electrons separate from atoms. \n\nThe plasma, which is superhot, produces a light pattern. (The science of analyzing this kind of light pattern is called spectroscopy.) Different elements produce different patterns, but McManus and her team say that gemstones from the same area produce similar patterns. Materialytics has already collected patterns from thousands of gemstones, including more than 200 from diamonds. They can compare the light pattern from an unknown gemstone to patterns they do know and look for a match. The light pattern acts like a signature, telling the researchers the origin of the gemstone. \n\nIn a small test, the laser technique correctly identified the origins of 95 out of every 100 diamonds. For gemstones like emeralds and rubies, the technique proved successful for 98 out of every 100 stones. The scientists need to collect and analyze more samples, including those from war-torn countries, before the tool is ready for commercial use. \n\nScientists like Barbara Dutrow, a mineralogist from Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge, find the technique exciting. \"This is a basic new tool that could provide a better fingerprint of a material from a particular locality,\" she told Science News.",

Imagine you are eating chocolate ice cream! \n\nAs long as you remember how to be happy you can ALWAYS be as young as Eduardo! And you can think of GREAT ways you can see him again!\" \n\nIt worked! She had an idea. Someone in a place called MR was buying stories that people wrote. She wrote one about her & Eduardo! \n\nIt paid for her airplane ride. Wow. \n\nThen they were together again.

For this purpose Ofcom established a telephone numbering plan, known as the \"National Telephone Numbering Plan\", which is the system for assigning telephone numbers to subscriber stations. Since 28 April 2001, almost all geographic numbers and most non-geographic numbers have 9 or 10 national (significant) numbers after the \"0\" trunk code. All mobile telephone numbers have 10 national (significant) numbers after the \"0\" trunk code. The overall structure of the UK's National Numbering Plan is: A short sample of geographic numbers, set out in the officially approved (Ofcom) number groups: In the United Kingdom, area codes are two, three, four, or, rarely, five digits long (after the initial zero). Regions with shorter area codes, typically large cities, permit the allocation of more telephone numbers as the local number portion has more digits. Local customer numbers are four to eight figures long. The total number of digits is ten, but in a very few areas the total may be nine digits (after the initial zero). The \"area code\" is also referred to as an \"STD (code)\" (subscriber trunk dialling) or a \"dialling code\" in the UK.",

See any of the fellows?\" \n\n\"Not yet, Dave. But we are sure to meet somebody, even if it is a school-day,\" went on the senator's son. \n\n\"Uncle Dunston, let me take the auto around to the hotel,\" said our hero. \"I know the streets better than you do. We have to make several turns.\" \n\n\"All right, Dave,\" was the ready answer, and Dunston Porter arose and allowed his nephew to crowd into the driver's seat. \n\nThe run to the town in the vicinity of which Oak Hall was located had been made without further incident. On the way the party had talked over Mrs. Breen's affairs, and Dunston Porter had promised to take the matter up, through his lawyer. \n\n\"I think it best that our names don't appear in the case,\" said he. \"Otherwise, Mr. Haskers might not treat you so well during the term.\" \n\n\"He never treats us well, anyway,\" grumbled Phil. \"But you are right, don't mention our names.\" \n\nOn this late winter day the town looked rather dreary, but the young folks were in high spirits, and Dave, with a grand flourish, ran the car up to one of the best hotels the place afforded. As before, word had been sent ahead that they were coming, and the host of the resort came out to meet them. \n\n\"We'll have dinner ready inside of quarter of an hour,\" he said. \"Come in and make yourselves at home.\" ",

NOCs also promote the development of athletes and training of coaches and officials at a national level within their geographies. \n\nAs of 2016, there are 206 NOCs: Each of the 193 member states of the United Nations; United Nations observer state Palestine; the Cook Islands, a state in free association with New Zealand whose capacity to participate in international organizations has been recognized by the United Nations Secretariat; and two states with limited recognition, Kosovo and Taiwan (designated as \"Chinese Taipei\" by the IOC). \n\nThere are also nine dependent territories with NOCs: \n\nPrior to 1996, rules for recognising separate countries within the IOC were not as strict as those within the United Nations, which allowed these territories to field teams separately from their sovereign state. Following an amendment to the Olympic Charter in 1996, NOC recognition can only be granted after recognition as an independent state by the international community. Since the rule does not apply retroactively, the dependent territories which were recognised before the rule change are allowed to continue sending separate teams to the Olympics, while the Faroe Islands and Macau send their own Paralympic teams.",

Jerry would have liked to offer some suggestions, but he didn't quite dare. You see, he was very anxious not to displease his big cousin. But he felt that he simply had got to speak his mind to someone, so he swam across to where he had seen Peter Rabbit almost every night since Paddy began to build. Sure enough, Peter was there, sitting up very straight and staring with big round eyes at the platform of mud and sticks out in the water where Paddy the Beaver was at work. \n\n\"Well, Peter, what do you think of it?\" asked Jerry \n\n\"What is it?\" asked Peter innocently. \"Is it another dam?\" \n\nJerry threw back his head and laughed and laughed. \n\nPeter looked at him suspiciously. \"I don't see anything to laugh at,\" said he. \n\n\"Why, it's a house, you stupid. It's Paddy's new house,\" replied Jerry, wiping the tears of laughter from his eyes. \n\n\"I'm not stupid!\" retorted Peter. \"How was I to know that that pile of mud and sticks is meant for a house? It certainly doesn't look it. Where is the door?\" \n\n\"To tell you the truth, I don't think it is much of a house myself,\" replied Jerry. \"It has got a door, all right. In fact it has got three. You can't see them because they are under water, and there is a passage from each right up through that platform of mud and sticks, which is the foundation of the house. It really is a very fine foundation, Peter; it really is. But what I can't understand is what Paddy is thinking of by building that great pile of mud right in the middle. When he gets his walls built, where will his bedroom be? There won't be any room at all. It won't be a house at all--just a big useless pile of sticks and mud. ",

Ted Cruz and his allies came around 7 p.m. on Tuesday night. \n\nThe Texas Republican's suit was still crisp, despite more than four hours into what would become a rhetorical marathon of more than 21 hours on the Senate floor aimed at derailing Obamacare. \n\nBut until that point, the brunt of the speaking had been done by Cruz and his ally, Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah. Without more help, Lee's aides weren't sure how long the effort could continue. \n\nThen Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Florida, arrived. It was a sign that they'd get the bodies they needed for the long haul. \n\n\"When he showed up, we had a feeling that we could go until noon (the next day),\" said Lee spokesman Brian Phillips. \n\nLee was on or near the floor all night. Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, who held the floor for 12 hours in March, jumped in. Even ideological opponent Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Illinois, shouldered some speaking time while trying to refute Cruz' points. \n\nThat gave Cruz some time for mental breaks even though he couldn't leave the floor to eat, use the restroom or do anything else. \n\nFor material, staff pulled together binders of articles, talking points and documents that could be used to fill time. And as social networks heated up, aides ferried in a stream of tweets for Cruz to read. \n\nBut to the big and less comfortable question: How did he manage physically? \n\nGood, pliable shoes, for a start. Cruz left his trademark Ostrich boots behind and told the chamber that he picked up some sneakers in preparation for the long hours of standing. ",

But rarely have two leaders worked together with such friendship and cooperation as American President Franklin Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill. They both were born in wealthy families and were active in politics for many years. Both men loved the sea and the navy,history and nature. \n\nRoosevelt and Churchill first met when they were lowerlevel officials in World War One. But neither man remembered much about that meeting. However,as they worked together during the Second World War they came to like and trust each other. Roosevelt and Churchill exchanged more than one thousand seven hundred letters and messages during five and a half years. They met many times,at large national gatherings and in private talks. But the closeness of their friendship might be seen best in a story told by one of Roosevelt's close advisors,Harry Hopkins. Hopkins remembered how Churchill was visiting Roosevelt at the White House one day. Roosevelt went into Churchill's room in the morning to say hello. But the president was shocked to see Churchill coming from the washing room with no clothes at all. Roosevelt immediately apologized to the British leader for seeing him naked. But Churchill reportedly said: \"The Prime Minister of Great Britain has nothing to hide from the president of the United States.\" And then both men laughed. \n\nThe United States and Great Britain were only two of several nations that joined together in the war to resist Hitler and his Allies. In January,1942,twentysix of these nations signed an agreement promising to fight for peace,religious freedom,human rights,and justice. The three major Allies,however,were the most important for the war effort: the United States,Britain,and the Soviet Union. Yet,Churchill and Roosevelt disagreed about when to attack Hitler in western Europe. And Churchill resisted Roosevelt's suggestions that Britain give up some of its colonies. But in general,the friendship between Roosevelt and Churchill,and between the United States and Britain led the two nations to cooperate closely.",

According to Buddhist tradition, the Buddha lived and taught in the eastern part of the Indian subcontinent, present-day Nepal sometime between the 6th and 4th centuries BCE.[note 1] He is recognized by Buddhists as an awakened or enlightened teacher who shared his insights to help sentient beings end their suffering through the elimination of ignorance and craving. Buddhists believe that this is accomplished through the direct understanding and perception of dependent origination and the Four Noble Truths. \n\nTwo major extant branches of Buddhism are generally recognized by scholars: Theravada (\"The School of the Elders\") and Mahayana (\"The Great Vehicle\"). Vajrayana, a body of teachings attributed to Indian siddhas, may be viewed as a third branch or merely a part of Mahayana. Theravada has a widespread following in Sri Lanka and Southeast Asia. Mahayana which includes the traditions of Pure Land, Zen, Nichiren Buddhism, Shingon, and Tiantai (Tendai) is found throughout East Asia.

HOW THE BRUSHWOOD MEN CAME TO THE CHATEAU OF VILLEFRANCHE. \n\nIt was late ere Alleyne Edricson, having carried Sir Nigel the goblet of spiced wine which it was his custom to drink after the curling of his hair, was able at last to seek his chamber. It was a stone-flagged room upon the second floor, with a bed in a recess for him, and two smaller pallets on the other side, on which Aylward and Hordle John were already snoring. Alleyne had knelt down to his evening orisons, when there came a tap at his door, and Ford entered with a small lamp in his hand. His face was deadly pale, and his hand shook until the shadows flickered up and down the wall. \n\n\"What is it, Ford?\" cried Alleyne, springing to his feet. \n\n\"I can scarce tell you,\" said he, sitting down on the side of the couch, and resting his chin upon his hand. \"I know not what to say or what to think.\" \n\n\"Has aught befallen you, then?\" \n\n\"Yes, or I have been slave to my own fancy. I tell you, lad, that I am all undone, like a fretted bow-string. Hark hither, Alleyne! it cannot be that you have forgotten little Tita, the daughter of the old glass-stainer at Bordeaux?\" \n\n\"I remember her well.\" \n\n\"She and I, Alleyne, broke the lucky groat together ere we parted, and she wears my ring upon her finger. 'Caro mio,' quoth she when last we parted, 'I shall be near thee in the wars, and thy danger will be my danger.' Alleyne, as God is my help, as I came up the stairs this night I saw her stand before me, her face in tears, her hands out as though in warning--I saw it, Alleyne, even as I see those two archers upon their couches. Our very finger-tips seemed to meet, ere she thinned away like a mist in the sunshine.\" ",

It's the latest in a series of unusually public squabbles between Ahmadinejad and allies of Khamenei, the Islamic republic's clerical leader, in recent weeks. \n\nKhamenei backed Ahmadinejad through the tumult that followed his hotly disputed 2009 re-election, urging Iranians to accept the results of the balloting when protesters in the streets declared it a fraud. He presided over a crackdown on the demonstrations, during which security forces were unleashed on crowds and activists were prosecuted and jailed. \n\nBut elements throughout the government have moved to check Ahmadinejad's efforts to replace top officials and have gone after the president's closest advisers, U.S. analyst Alireza Nader told CNN. \n\n\"I think it's a symptom of the general dissatisfaction with President Ahmadinejad that his powers and movement are being curtailed by the various power centers in Iran,\" said Nader, an expert on Iranian politics at the RAND Corp., an American think tank. \n\nThe outspoken Ahmadinejad has long been a lightning rod for Iran's critics. But Haleh Esfandiari, director of Middle Eastern studies at the Woodrow Wilson International Center, said he may be left a \"lame duck\" after butting heads with Khamenei. ",

        "meta": "(CNN) -- Who is Stanislas Cordova? That's the burning question at the heart of \"Night Film,\" the anticipated follow-up to best-selling author Marisha Pessl's 2006 literary debut. \n\nPessl burst onto the scene in 2006 with \"Special Topics in Calamity Physics.\" She received a six-figure advance, almost unheard of for a first-time author, a ton of hype and even some snarky backlash over her photogenic looks. But the book lived up to expectations, selling some 200,000 copies and landing on The New York Times' list of Best Books of 2006. \n\nSeven years later, \"Night Film\" is hitting bookstores this week amid greater expectations and even more hype. Movie rights are already spoken for by Chernin Entertainment, the studio behind \"Oblivion\" and \"Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,\" and critics are raving about Pessl's multimedia storytelling approach, which takes readers beyond the novel's pages to explore the story of a mysterious director and the washed-up reporter out to expose him. \n\nPessl's fictional mash-up of Stanley Kubrick, Roman Polanski and David Lynch hasn't been seen in public for 30 years. His movies are so frightening no theater will show them; his cult of fans meet in abandoned buildings and underground tunnels for secret screenings. \n\nInvestigative journalist Scott McGrath tried to expose Cordova years ago and it backfired, costing him his job, marriage and reputation. When Cordova's daughter turns up dead in an apparent suicide, McGrath sees an opportunity to exact revenge against the man he blames for his downfall. \n\nPessl weaves into the narrative excerpts from magazine articles, newspaper headlines, police reports, crime scene photos and screen shots of online message boards. She also wrote and directed several short films being featured over the next few weeks on YouTube that offer clues into the book's mystery, including snippets and trailers from Cordova's films. ",

He also had a run-scoring single in the fourth inning. \n\nTigers pitching ace Justin Verlander only managed to go four innings, allowing five runs on six hits. \n\nSandoval, who had 12 home runs during the regular season, hit a solo home run in the first and a two-run shot in the third off Verlander. In the fifth, he added another home run off Al Alburquerque. He has six home runs in the postseason. \n\n\"In this situation you're going to face the best. For me I just go in there and don't thinking too much or try to do too much, get a pitch you can hit, take advantage of the mistakes he be making. That's a part of my game.\" Sandoval said. \n\nHis manager said Sandoval has been swinging the bat well for weeks. \n\n\"He's been locked in for a while, and the home runs, really where he hit them, too, it's not easy to hit them where he hit them,\" Giants skipper Bruce Bochy said. \n\nThree other players have homered three times in one World Series game. \n\nBabe Ruth did it twice, and Reggie Jackson also achieved the feat. Last year, St. Louis Cardinals slugger Albert Pujols had three home runs in Game 3. ",

I shall never be happy--not really happy--until I have settled down to study hard. My music is really the only part of life which absolutely appeals to me.\" \n\nLady Ashleigh sighed. \n\n\"It seems so unnecessary,\" she murmured. \"Since Esther was married you are practically an only daughter, you are quite well off, and there are so many young men who want to marry you.\" ",

The men had guns in their hands, and were got up with all proper sporting appurtenances, but it so turned out that they did not reach the stubble-fields on the farther side of the road until after luncheon. And may it not be fairly doubted whether croquet is not as good as shooting when a man is in love? \n\nIt will be said that Bernard Dale was not in love; but they who bring such accusation against him, will bring it falsely. He was in love with his cousin Bell according to his manner and fashion. It was not his nature to love Bell as John Eames loved Lily; but then neither would his nature bring him into such a trouble as that which the charms of Amelia Roper had brought upon the poor clerk from the Income-tax Office. Johnny was susceptible, as the word goes; whereas Captain Dale was a man who had his feelings well under control. He was not one to make a fool of himself about a girl, or to die of a broken heart; but, nevertheless, he would probably love his wife when he got a wife, and would be a careful father to his children.

After missing a shot at a golden plover, he became involved in an argument over which was the fastest game bird in Europe, the golden plover or the red grouse. (It is the plover.) That evening at Castlebridge House, he realized that it was impossible to confirm in reference books whether or not the golden plover was Europe's fastest game bird. Beaver knew that there must be numerous other questions debated nightly in pubs throughout Ireland and abroad, but there was no book in the world with which to settle arguments about records.

She was THE child star--the sweet little girl whose shining smile helped _ some of the darkest days the US has known during the Great Depression. \n\nIt's hard today to imagine the super star Shirley was once \"America's Little Darling\". She sang and danced her way to the top of the box office in such films as Bright Eyes, Curly Top and Heidi. By 1940, she had appeared in 43 films. Temple teamed with Bill Robison in four movies, and their dance on the stairs in The Little Colonel is still a legendary film moment. \n\nIn the 1930s, her name on a movie introduction assured a packed house. She inspired dolls, dresses, dishes--even a drink (alcohol-free, of course). \n\nUS President Franklin D. Roosevelt once famously said that \"as long as our country has Shirley Temple, we will be all right.'' \n\nUnlike so many of today's child stars, Temple didn't end up with her name appearing across the headlines for bad behaviors. Instead of getting her photos on front pages or struggling with drugs and alcohol, Temple went on to a second career in diplomacy , including presidential appointments as ambassador to Ghana. \n\nShe surprised a lot of people who doubted her with her grace, knowledge and eagerness to serve. In fact, her career in public service (20 years) was longer than her career in movies (19). The role she valued most, however, was as wife, mother, grandmother and great-grandmother. \n\nThe world has lost a treasured Hollywood legend. But her movies will allow that little dynamic figure to continue charming audiences for a very long time.",

Additionally, Siena, Lucca, the Chianti region, Versilia and Val d'Orcia are also internationally renowned and particularly popular spots among travellers. \n\nSeven Tuscan localities have been designated World Heritage Sites: the historic centre of Florence (1982); the Cathedral square of Pisa (1987); the historical centre of San Gimignano (1990); the historical centre of Siena (1995); the historical centre of Pienza (1996); the Val d'Orcia (2004), and the Medici Villas and Gardens (2013). Tuscany has over 120 protected nature reserves, making Tuscany and its capital Florence popular tourist destinations that attract millions of tourists every year. In 2012, the city of Florence was the world's 89th most visited city, with over 1.834 million arrivals.",

They met with no special adventures by the way, except that when they reached the great pine-tree, Phonny proposed to climb up, for the purpose of examining a small bunch which he saw upon one of the branches, which he thought was a bird's nest. It was the same pine-tree that marked the place at which a road branched off into the woods, where Mary Bell had lost her way, several years before. Malleville was very unwilling to have Phonny climb up upon such a high tree, but Phonny himself was very desirous to make the attempt. There was a log fence at the foot of the tree, and the distance was not very great from the uppermost log of the fence, to the lowermost branch of the tree. So Phonny thought that he could get up without any difficulty. \n\nMalleville was afraid to have him try, and she said that if he did, he would be acting just as foolish as the boy that Beechnut had told them about, who nipped his own nose; and that she should not stop to see him do any such foolishness. So she walked along as fast as she could go. \n\nPhonny unfortunately was rendered only the more determined to climb the tree by Malleville's opposition. He accordingly mounted up to the top of the fence, and thence reaching the lower branches of the tree he succeeded at length, by dint of much scrambling and struggling, in lifting himself up among them. He climbed out to the limb where he had seen the appearances of a bird's nest, but found to his disappointment that there was no bird's nest there. The bunch was only a little tuft of twigs growing out together. ",

You may have been free, you loved living your lie, fate had its own scheme, crushed like a bug you still die,\" Israel Keyes wrote. \n\nKeyes killed himself in December. He was in custody in the killing of barista Samantha Koenig, 18, whom he abducted from a coffee stand in Anchorage, Alaska, last February. Koenig was one of at least eight people Keyes admitted to killing, but he may have taken other lives, police have said. \n\nKeyes' notes were released by the FBI on Wednesday after they were cleaned up at the bureau's lab in Quantico, Virginia. They were found under his body, written in a combination of pencil and ink on a yellow legal pad, the FBI said in a statement. \n\nThe bureau said the notes don't confirm any of his killings, add any new victims to his grisly toll, or offer any other clues that might help their investigation. It said an analysis showed no hidden messages or code in the four pages. \n\nBut a read of them does give a glimpse into Keyes' mind, apparently describing how it felt to take a life and the disdain in which he held much of American society. \n\n\"I looked in your eyes, they were so dark, warm and trusting as though you had not a worry or care. The more guiless (sp) the gaze the better potential to fill up those pools with your fear,\" Keyes wrote at one point. ",

Cecil will not let me stay any longer. He was here himself the day before yesterday. We take it by turns to come away.\" \n\n\"And there is nothing to tell me?\" the Princess asked. \"No change of any sort?\" \n\n\"None,\" Forrest answered. \"It is no good attempting to persuade ourselves that there is any.\" \n\n\"What are you up for, then?\" she asked. \n\nHe laughed hardly. \n\n\"I am like a diver,\" he answered, \"who has to come to the surface every now and then for fresh air. Life down at Salthouse is very nearly the acme of stagnation. Our only excitement day by day is the danger--and the hope.\" \n\n\"Is Cecil getting braver?\" the Princess asked. \n\n\"I think that he is, a little,\" Forrest answered. \n\nThe Princess nodded. \n\n\"We met him at the Bellamy Smiths',\" she said. \"It was quite a reunion. Andrew was there, and the Duke.\" \n\nForrest's face darkened. \n\n\"Meddling fool,\" he muttered. \"Do you know that there are two detectives now in Salthouse? They come and go and ask all manner of questions. One of them pretends that he believes Engleton was drowned, and walks always on the beach and hires boatmen to explore the creeks. The other sits in the inn and bribes the servants with drinks to talk. But don't let's talk about this any longer. How is Jeanne?\" ",

Were they sweet, Bryan? Did they remind you of the fair maid of Derry, hey?\" \n\n\"Ah! thrue for ye,\" replied the blacksmith, as he stepped to a rock for the purpose of whetting his knife; \"yer honour was just in time to save me a power o' throuble. Bad skran to the baste! it would have taken three or four rounds at laste to have finished him nately off, for there's no end o' fat on his ribs that would have kep' the knife from goin' far in.\" \n\nFrank laughed at this free-and-easy way of looking at it. \"So you think you would have killed him, do you, if I had not saved you the trouble?\" \n\n\"Av coorse I do. Shure a man is better than a baste any day; and besides, had I not a frind at my back ridy to help me?\" Bryan cast a comical leer at La Roche as he said this, and the poor Frenchman blushed, for he felt that his conduct in the affair had not been very praiseworthy. It is due to La Roche to say, however, that no sooner had he found himself at the top of the tree, and had a moment to reflect, than he slid rapidly to the bottom again, and ran to the assistance of his friend, not, however, in time to render such assistance available, as he came up just at the moment the bear fell.

Three bullets hit the back window and trunk of the car, he added. \n\nWitnesses said there were at least two gunmen. \n\nAl-Amrani was not hurt in the attack, al-Qaedi said. \n\nThe minister's office said al-Amrani has been targeted recently in a hate campaign by pro-revolution groups. \n\n\"A number of factions in the country started a hate campaign against the minister and threats were given to him in the past,\" said al-Qaedi. \n\nYemen's Interior Ministry told CNN the attack is under investigation, but there are no prime suspects. \n\nLast week, al-Amrani received a death threat by an anonymous caller from a Saudi telephone number, al-Qaedi said. \n\nThe minister recently launched a massive presidential campaign to support candidate Abdurabu Hadi, the country's current vice president. \n\nAl-Amrani told CNN the country is facing a critical time for change and all Yemenis must stand together to support Hadi. \n\nYemen has been beset with demonstrations against President Ali Abdullah Saleh since early last year, when pro-democratic uprisings spread across the Arab world. \n\nDemonstrators have continued their protests against the president, despite a power transfer deal that leads to his departure. \n\nUnder the plan, Saleh -- who's been in office for 33 years -- will step down after the February 21 elections and will receive immunity under the plan forged by the Gulf Cooperation Council.

Their homes are walking distance from each other and from a park. \n\nIt was in that park where, according to Meyers' husband, she used to talk to the young man, where she implored him to act like an adult. \n\nOn Thursday, Nowsch was arrested, accused of killing Meyers in what has been described as a road rage incident that ended a week ago with a shooting in front of Meyers' home. \n\n\"We know this boy. I couldn't tell you this before,\" Robert Meyers told reporters after the arrest. \"He knew where I lived. We knew how bad he was, but we didn't know it was this bad. That he'd gotten to this point, and his friends.\" \n\nNowsch, 19, faces three felony charges: murder, attempted murder and unlawful discharge of a gun from a vehicle. A Monday morning court hearing has been scheduled. \n\nRobert Meyers said his wife tried to help Nowsch. \n\n\"My wife spent countless hours at that park consoling this boy,\" he said. \"She was really good to him. She fed him, she gave him money. She told him to pull his pants up and to be a man. More times than I can count.\" \n\nPolice said they are looking for at least one more suspect, but they believe Nowsch was the shooter. Homicide Capt. Chris Tomaino told reporters that he owned registered firearms but wouldn't say how many guns or what type of weapons they were. \n\nIt was unclear Thursday night whether Nowsch had an attorney; court documents detailing his charges didn't list a lawyer.

        "meta": "(CNN) -- November 6, 2008, 9:06 a.m.: Ernie Casillas can peg the downward spiral of his life to that exact minute, when he was fired from his job as a mortgage broker. Barack Obama had just been elected president as Casillas was leaving the work force. \n\nNearly four years later, as Obama seeks reelection, Casillas has finally landed his first full-time job, emerging out of the group known as the long-term unemployed. \n\nThe Labor Department's July employment figures on Friday showed the average duration of unemployment shrank from 39.9 weeks in June to 38.8 weeks in July. The percentage of people who are unemployed long-term (27 weeks or longer) shrank from 41.9% in June to 40.7% in July. \n\nCasillas says his life is evidence that the economy is beginning to turn around. But the road to his new job was painful, heartbreaking and financially devastating. \n\nJuly jobs report: Hiring picks up, unemployment rises \n\nHe remembers his life pre-November 2008: He wore expensive suits, drove a Mercedes and spent every cent of his paycheck. When he was laid off, he thought he'd be back at work in two weeks. \n\nHe was wrong. \n\nThe subprime mortgage crisis was eating away at the U.S. economy. Employers were shedding jobs, not adding them. A few credits shy of his associate degree, Casillas found himself overqualified for many jobs but underqualified for higher-paid middle-class ones. \n\n\"Overqualified, what does that mean?\" Casillas remembers. \"They kept telling me that. Meanwhile, my life is going down the drain.\" \n\nHe lost his house, his Mercedes, and then his wife left him. In his 40s, he was forced to take the humiliating step of moving in with his mother. A year after he lost his job, he began selling everything he owned on Craigslist. ",

        "meta": "Sports Illustrated is an American sports media franchise owned by Time Inc. Its self-titled magazine has over 3 million subscribers and is read by 23 million people each week, including over 18 million men. It was the first magazine with circulation over one million to win the National Magazine Award for General Excellence twice. Its swimsuit issue, which has been published since 1964, is now an annual publishing event that generates its own television shows, videos and calendars. \n\nThere were two magazines named \"Sports Illustrated\" before the current magazine began on August 16, 1954. In 1936, Stuart Scheftel created \"Sports Illustrated\" with a target market for the sportsman. He published the magazine from 1936 to 1938 on a monthly basis. The magazine was a life magazine size and focused on golf, tennis, and skiing with articles on the major sports. He then sold the name to Dell Publications, which released \"Sports Illustrated\" in 1949 and this version lasted 6 issues before closing. Dell's version focused on major sports (baseball, basketball, boxing) and competed on magazine racks against \"Sport\" and other monthly sports magazines. During the 1940s these magazines were monthly and they did not cover the current events because of the production schedules. There was no large-base, general, weekly sports magazine with a national following on actual active events. It was then that \"Time\" patriarch Henry Luce began considering whether his company should attempt to fill that gap. At the time, many believed sports was beneath the attention of serious journalism and did not think sports news could fill a weekly magazine, especially during the winter. A number of advisers to Luce, including \"Life\" magazine's Ernest Havemann, tried to kill the idea, but Luce, who was not a sports fan, decided the time was right.",

As he opened his green eyes slowly, he saw a bit of fur. Then he saw a tongue. After that, some more fur and then slurp! He was licked again! \n\n\"Oh, Boscoe!\" the little boy said with joy as he kissed his furry little brown dog. The dog had been Scott's friend for as long as could remember. They went on many adventures together. The two of them really never left each other's side and Scott woke up many times this way. \n\nOne of the most memorable adventures that Scott and Boscoe had happened when Scott was 12. Scott wanted to have a little fun. He also wanted to adventure with Boscoe. Scott had got done eating breakfast and wanted to ride his bicycle. Boscoe was walking and Scott was riding his bicycle down by the park very close to the river near Scott's house. He wanted to do a little adventuring. Boscoe was walking next to the shore and started barking his head off! Scott wasn't sure what he was barking at, so he got off his bicycle and ran down into the river to see what all the noise was about. \n\nAll of the sudden, Boscoe fell in the water and was taken down stream with the fast water. Scott yelled, \"Boscoe!\" and he was off. He jumped into the water and began swimming after Boscoe. Boscoe's little legs were doggy paddling as fast as they could, but had no hope! Finally, Scott caught up to him, but he couldn't get back to the side of the river! \n\nAs Scott was thinking this was the last of him and Boscoe, a large stick from a fallen log was well in reach and Scott grabbed it and using all of this might, he pulled him and Boscoe out of the river. \n\n\"Boy, was that close!\" Scott yelled out loud! \n\nThat was the best adventure ever!",

In that country, a nod means\"no\". Tom had a similar problem when he arrived in India. After explaining something in class, he asked his students if they understood. They answered with many different nods and shakes of the head. He thought some people had not understood, so he explained again. When he asked again, they did the same thing.

        "meta": "(The Frisky) -- By T-minus 18 days until the Oscars and, of course, we are all starting to place bets on who we think will walk away with little golden men this year. Luckily, the Academy has proven itself to be pretty darn predictable over the years. If you're America's Sweetheart, you'll probably win Best Actress. If you sing in a flick, you are almost guaranteed Oscar gold. But there's another trend we've been noticing lately: the winners for Best Actress and Best Actor tend to be the person who's taken on the based-on-a-true-story role. In fact, 10 of the 20 top honors given in the 2000s went to actors who portrayed real people. Let's take a look, shall we? \n\nLast year, Sandra Bullock won Best Actress -- just days after taking home a Razzie -- for playing Leigh Anne Tuohy, the Southern mom who took in Michael Oher and helped coach him toward football greatness. The real Leigh Anne was in the theater to see Sandra accept her award. \n\nThe Frisky: 12 Female Celebs Reveal Their True Size \n\nIn 2008, Sean Penn won the Academy Award for Best Actor -- again! -- for playing Harvey Milk, the first openly gay man to be elected to public office in California. \n\nI still remember the gorgeous mermaid-scale gown that Marion Cotillard won when she accepted the Oscar for Best Actress in 2007 for her role in \"La Vie En Rose.\" In the movie, she played Edith Piaf, an extremely popular singer in France who was also known for her out-of-control social life. In many ways, Marion won for playing the Britney Spears of 1950s France. ",

What went wrong? \n\nThe joy, spontaneity and humor of Robin Williams likely masked the daily torment he endured in his on-again-off-again struggle with depression. He made us laugh out here, but he was in pain in there. Unfortunately, I know that pain. \n\nIn his death, we have lost one of the most talented and creative spirits on the planet. Still, his death by suicide should be a wake-up call for us all. It is to remind us that many of us are walking a fine line -- smiling on the outside while slowly dying on the inside. \n\nI didn't know Robin personally, so I am unable to speak with any certainty as to why he chose to end his life. But I have experienced that kind of torment and pain. For years, I, too, struggled with depression. And many days, I still do. \n\nComplete coverage on Robin Williams \n\nThose who are suffering will do just about anything not to feel the pain anymore. And in those moments, their brains become their worst enemies. It often takes an outside force to provide light, to make sure those dark thoughts aren't, as in the case of Robin, our last thoughts. \n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Center, suicide rates increased from 2000 to 2011 from 10.4 deaths per 100,000 to 12.3 deaths per 100,000. \n\nThe rate of suicide is higher and rising among men. In 2011, 78.5% of suicides were by men, at a rate of 20.2 deaths per 100,000. ",

Due to its great size in comparison to other English counties, functions have been undertaken over time by its subdivisions, which have also been subject to periodic reform. Throughout these changes, Yorkshire has continued to be recognised as a geographical territory and cultural region. The name is familiar and well understood across the United Kingdom and is in common use in the media and the military, and also features in the titles of current areas of civil administration such as North Yorkshire, South Yorkshire, West Yorkshire and East Riding of Yorkshire. \n\nWithin the borders of the historic county of Yorkshire are areas which are widely considered to be among the greenest in England, due to the vast stretches of unspoilt countryside in the Yorkshire Dales and North York Moors and to the open aspect of some of the major cities. Yorkshire has sometimes been nicknamed \"God's Own County\" or \"God's Own Country\". \n\nThe emblem of Yorkshire is the White Rose of the English royal House of York, and the most commonly used flag representative of Yorkshire is the White Rose on a blue background, which after nearly fifty years of use, was recognised by the Flag Institute on 29 July 2008. Yorkshire Day, held annually on 1 August, is a celebration of the general culture of Yorkshire, ranging from its history to its own dialect.",

But as she hurried down the subway stairs, she started to feel uncomfortably warm. By the time she got to the platform, Linda felt weak and tired -- maybe it hadn't been a good idea to give blood the night before, she thought. She rested herself against a post close to the tracks. \n\nSeveral yards away, Frank, 43, and his girlfriend, Jennifer, found a spot close to where the front of the train would stop. They were deep in discussion about a house they were thinking of buying. \n\nBut when he heard the scream, followed by someone yelling, \"Oh, my God, she fell in!\"Frank didn't hesitate. He jumped down to the tracks and ran some 40 feet toward the body lying on the rails. \"No ! Not you ! \"his girlfriend screamed after him. \n\nShe was right to be alarmed. By the time Frank reached Linda, he could feel the tracks shaking and see the light coming. The train was about 20 seconds from the station. \n\nIt was hard to lift her. She was just out. But he managed to raise her the four feet to the platform so that bystanders could hold her by the arms and drag her away from the edge. That was where Linda briefly regained consciousness, felt herself being pulled along the ground, and saw someone else holding her purse. \n\nLinda thought she'd been robbed. A woman held her hand and a man gave his shirt to help stop the blood pouring from her head. And she tried to talk but she couldn't, and that was when she realized how much pain she was in. \n\nPolice and fire officials soon arrived, and Frank told the story to an officer. Jennifer said her boyfriend was calm on their 40minute train ride downtown--just as he had been seconds after the rescue, which made her think about her reaction at the time. \"I saw the train coming and I was thinking he was going to die, \" she explained.",

It's all on the public record, and I feel very good about it. If I had to do it over again, I'd do it in a minute,\" Dick Cheney says in \"The World According to Dick Cheney,\" which debuts at 9 p.m. ET on Showtime. \n\nThe two-hour documentary tells the story of Cheney's life through his own comments, supplemented by a narrator and interviews with journalists, biographers, former aides and his longtime friend and mentor Donald Rumsfeld, the former secretary of Defense. \n\nWhile the film covers Cheney's unprecedented and controversial role as vice president, the first half of the film explores the surprising tale of his rise from a two-time Yale dropout with two drunk-driving arrests to the man who once stood behind the leader of the free world. \n\nIn \"The World According to Dick Cheney,\" produced by R.J. Cutler \u2014 also known for \"The War Room\" and \"The September Issue\" -- the former Washington powerhouse gets personal, but he still maintains his ever-steady, matter-of-fact tone. \n\n\"When you came in at night after work, you'd go to the bar and down large quantities of Coors beer,\" he stated coolly, referring to the two times he was arrested for drinking and driving in his home state of Wyoming. \n\nNoticeably absent from the documentary are details about Cheney's post-White House life. The 72-year-old gives little to no insight about his heart transplant last year or his decision to support same-sex marriage. His younger daughter Mary wed her longtime partner Heather Poe in June.

This settlement continued as a trading post for the Roman Empire, until it was surpassed by the more prosperous village of Sutton, now called Plymouth. In 1620, the Pilgrim Fathers departed Plymouth for the New World and established Plymouth Colony \u2013 the second English settlement in what is now the United States of America. During the English Civil War the town was held by the Parliamentarians and was besieged between 1642 and 1646. \n\nThroughout the Industrial Revolution, Plymouth grew as a commercial shipping port, handling imports and passengers from the Americas, and exporting local minerals (tin, copper, lime, china clay and arsenic) while the neighbouring town of Devonport became a strategic Royal Naval shipbuilding and dockyard town. In 1914 three neighbouring independent towns, viz., the county borough of Plymouth, the county borough of Devonport, and the urban district of East Stonehouse were merged to form a single County Borough. The combined town took the name of Plymouth which, in 1928, achieved city status. The city's naval importance later led to its targeting and partial destruction during World War II, an act known as the Plymouth Blitz. After the war the city centre was completely rebuilt and subsequent expansion led to the incorporation of Plympton and Plymstock along with other outlying suburbs in 1967.",

There could get mud out of the pond but that would be too soft and splat when they hit it with the wooden bat.

But the dudish fellow was too scared to do anything but back away to a safe distance. \n\n\"Don--don't you dare to hit me, Porter!\" he cried, in a trembling voice. \"Don't you dare! If you do I'll tell Doctor Clay!\" \n\n\"If you behave yourself I'll not lay my fingers on you, Nat Poole,\" was the reply. \"Merwell brought this on himself--you know that as well as I do.\" \n\n\"He's pretty badly hurt, I fear.\" \n\n\"Oh, he'll come around all right,\" answered Dave. \"You had better see to it that he gets to the Hall safely.\" \n\n\"Are you going to leave me?\" \n\n\"Yes, I want to find Henshaw and the others.\" \n\nNat Poole wanted to argue, but he did not dare. Dave waited until Link Merwell sat up and opened his eyes. Then he leaped on the ice-boat and flung off the three skates he found there. \n\n\"Going away?\" mumbled Merwell, when he could speak. \n\n\"Yes, and after this, Link Merwell, see that you keep a civil tongue in your head,\" answered Dave, and then he trimmed the sail of the ice-boat, shoved the craft around, and started for the river. \n\nDave was a good deal \"worked up,\" but he had not deemed it wise to let his enemies see it. To be called a \"poorhouse rat\" had stung him to the quick, and once again when touched on that subject he had found his temper as ungovernable as ever. ",

Uncle John was bent upon getting to Rome and Venice, and from there to Paris, and the nieces were willing to go anywhere he preferred, as they were sure to enjoy every day of their trip in the old world. But Mr. Watson urged them strongly to visit Syracuse, since they were not likely to return to Sicily again and the most famous of all the ancient historic capitals was only a few hours' journey from Taormina. So it was finally decided to pass a week in Syracuse before returning to the continent, and preparations were at once begun for their departure. \n\nKenneth pleaded for one more day in which to finish his picture of Etna, and this was allowed him. Uncle John nevertheless confessed to being uneasy as long as they remained on the scene of his recent exciting experiences. Mr. Watson advised them all not to stray far from the hotel, as there was no certainty that Il Duca would not make another attempt to entrap them, or at least to be revenged for their escape from his clutches. \n\nOn the afternoon of the next day, however, they were startled by a call from the Duke in person. He was dressed in his usual faded velvet costume and came to them leading by the hand a beautiful little girl. \n\nThe nieces gazed at the child in astonishment. \n\nTato wore a gray cloth gown, ill-fitting and of coarse material; but no costume could destroy the fairy-like perfection of her form or the daintiness of her exquisite features. With downcast eyes and a troubled expression she stood modestly before them until Patsy caught her rapturously in her arms and covered her face with kisses. ",

A global city, Toronto is an international centre of business, finance, arts, and culture. \n\nToronto is located in Southern Ontario on the northwestern shore of Lake Ontario on a broad sloping plateau interspersed with rivers, deep ravines, and urban forest. Indigenous peoples have travelled through and inhabited the area for more than 10,000 years. After the broadly disputed Toronto Purchase, when the Mississaugas surrendered the area to the British Crown, the British established the town of York in 1793, and later designated it as the capital of Upper Canada. During the War of 1812, the town was the site of the Battle of York and suffered heavy damage by U.S. troops. York was renamed and incorporated as the city of Toronto in 1834, and became the capital of the province of Ontario during Canadian Confederation in 1867. The city proper has since expanded past its original borders through both annexation and amalgamation to its current area of .",

Fluffy was the leader of the group, and whatever he said, the others did. One day he said, \"Hey, everybody, let's go chase some mice.\" Everyone said \"Yes!\" except Larry. Larry did not want to chase mice. Larry wanted to drink some milk. He told Fluffy, and Fluffy only said \"too bad.\" So everyone went off to chase mice. The next day Fluffy said, \"Hey, everybody, let's go annoy the dogs.\" Everyone said \"Yes\" except Larry. Larry thought it was a bad idea. He told Fluffy, and Fluffy only said, \"Too bad.\" So everyone went off to annoy the dogs. Except Larry. When the cats annoyed the dogs, the dogs became very angry. They started growling. They caught the kittens in their paws. The kittens yelled, \"Help us!\" Larry heard, and he ran over and hissed at the dogs. The dogs could not see Larry, only his shadow, which looked very big. The dogs got scared and ran away, and the kittens cheered. \"Yay Larry! We'll do anything you want!\"",

They really liked being with each other, only it was difficult as Erin lived in England and Kevin lived in the United States. Because they both liked traveling and Erin wanted to see Kevin, she planned a trip to see him in the United States one summer. They had planned to travel around where Kevin lived and then go to see New York City at one point in order to see the sights and have a really nice steak dinner together. Once Erin arrived and met Kevin at the airport, she ran up to him and jumped into his arms, giving him a great big hug. They drove home where Kevin helped Erin organize her things before they changed and watched a movie together. The next day, they went out to have breakfast at the diner. They thought about getting eggs, French toast, or cereal... but couldn't make up their minds. Finally, Kevin asked the worker to bring out pancakes for the two of them to share. They had a really fun time together, visiting the beach, watching movies, and even visiting New York City like they had planned. In the morning, they went to see the Empire State building. In the afternoon, they saw the Statue of Liberty and Central Park. At night, they went to have their dinner and went back to their hotel. As Erin's trip was ending, Erin became really sad about leaving Kevin. They talked and came up with a plan for the months ahead which made Erin feel a lot better.

        "meta": "(CNN)As art, film stills are often overlooked. \n\nThe photographers tend to be anonymous; it's easy to imagine their work done by the director or cinematographer. Their images are often lumped in with the promotional machinery: Whether documenting the stars frolicking on set or getting down to business, it's just another form of salesmanship. \n\nWhich is why the work of Ernst Haas is so striking. \n\nHaas, one of the 20th century's great photojournalists and image-makers -- an early member of the great Magnum Photos cooperative who was famous enough in his prime to have been the subject of a Museum of Modern Art exhibit in 1962 -- was also a regular on movie sets. It was a necessity in those early days, said John Jacob, the editor of a new book of Haas' movie photography, \"Ernst Haas: On Set.\" \n\n\"Working on film sets was really important to Magnum, and all of the photographers working with Magnum in the '50s did films,\" says Jacob, now the McEvoy Family Curator for Photography at the Smithsonian American Art Museum. Not only did the work pay off financially, but the photographers also established relationships with members of the industry, he said. \n\nAnd the stars and directors knew what they were getting: some of the best in the field. Photographers such as Haas were entrusted to bring their talent and style to the work. \n\nThe photographers \"are definitely producing work for posterity, that very much has their own fingerprint on it,\" Jacob said. \n\nSuch distinction is obvious from looking at Haas' work -- some of which is as famous as the movies he worked on.

He did his best, but this time fell behind Powell by four inches. \n\n\"You ought to have stuck to the other hammer, Jackson,\" laughed the youth who composed songs. \n\n\"Don't you throw that up to me!\" whispered Jackson fiercely. \"If you do I'll hammer you for it.\" \n\n\"Is that meant for a pun, Jackson?\" \n\n\"No, it ain't. I won't stand being slurred. I'll pound you good.\" \n\n\"With the hammer?\" \n\n\"No, with my fists.\" \n\n\"Really? Well, you'll have to spell able first.\" Tom came next, as before, and now the hammer flew out four feet and nine inches beyond his first mark. \n\n\"That shows what the other hammer can do,\" said Major Larry. \n\nLarson was as much out of sorts as Jackson, but nevertheless he resolved to do his best to win the contest. Up went the hammer with a mighty swing and circled through the air. But the throw was behind that of Tom by fourteen inches. \n\n\"Hurrah! Tom Rover wins!\" was the cry, and many rushed forward to congratulate him, while Larson and Jackson retired as quickly as they could and in great disgust. \n\nThe next contest was a dash of two hundred yards and was won by a boy named Bird. \n\n\"He's a bird!\" sang out Tom loudly, and at this the crowd laughed heartily.

Have you marked but the fall of the snow, Before the soil hath smutched it?--BEN JONSON \n\nAt the end of a week Mervyn made his appearance in a vehement hurry. Cecily's next sister, an officer's wife, was coming home with two little children, for a farewell visit before going to the Cape, and Maria and Bertha must make way for her. So he wanted to take Phoebe home that afternoon to get the Underwood ready for them. \n\n'Mervyn, how can I go? I am not nearly ready.' \n\n'What can you have been doing then?' he exclaimed, with something of his old temper. \n\n'This house has been in such a state.' \n\n'Well, you were not wanted to nurse the sick man, were you? I thought you were one that was to be trusted. What more is there to do?' \n\nPhoebe looked at her list of commissions, and found herself convicted. Those patterns ought to have been sent back two days since. What had she been about? Listening to Mr. Randolf's explanations of the _Hiawatha_ scenery! Why had she not written a note about that hideous hearth-rug? Because Mr. Randolf was looking over Stowe's _Survey of London_. Methodical Phoebe felt herself in disgrace, and yet, somehow, she could not be sorry enough; she wanted a reprieve from exile at Hiltonbury, alone and away from all that was going on. At least she should hear whether _Macbeth_, at the Princess's Theatre, fulfilled Mr. Randolf's conceptions of it; and if Mr. Currie approved his grand map of the Newcastle district, with the little trees that she had taught him to draw.

        "meta": "The Board Meeting had come to an end. Bob started to stand up and knocked into the table, spilling his coffee over his notes. \"How embarrassing! I am getting so clumsy in my old age.\" \n\nEveryone had a good laugh, and soon we were all telling stories of our most embarrassing moments. It came around to Frank, who sat quietly listening to the others. Someone said, \"Come on, Frank. Tell us your most embarrassing moment.\" \n\nFrank laughed and began to tell us of his childhood. \"I grew up in San Pedro. My Dad was a fisherman, and he loved the sea. He had his own boat, but it was hard making a living on the sea. He worked hard and would stay out until he caught enough to feed the family. Not just enough for our family, but also for his Mom and Dad and the other kids that were still at home.\" \n\nHe looked at us and said, \"I wish you could have met my Dad. He was a big man, and he was strong from pulling the nets and fighting the seas for his catch. When you got close to him, he smelled like the ocean. He would wear his old canvas, foul-weather coat and his bibbed overalls. His rain hat would be pulled down over his brow. No matter how much my mother washed them, they would still smell of the sea and of fish.\" \n\nFrank's voice dropped a bit. \"When the weather was bad he would drive me to school. He had this old truck that he used in his fishing business. That truck was older than he was. It would wheeze and rattle down the road. You could hear it coming for blocks. As he would drive toward the school, I would shrink down into the seat hoping to disappear. Half the time, he would slam to a stop and the old truck would belch a cloud of smoke. He would pull right up in front, and it seemed like everybody would be standing around and watching. Then he would lean over and give me a big kiss on the cheek and tell me to be a good boy. It was so embarrassing for me. Here, I was twelve years old, and my Dad would lean over and kiss me goodbye!\" \n\nHe paused and then went on, \"I remember the day I decided I was too old for a goodbye kiss. When we got to the school and came to a stop, he had his usual big smile. He started to lean toward me, but I put my hand up and said, \"No, Dad.\" It was the first time I had ever talked to him that way, and he had this surprised look on his face. I said, \"Dad, I'm too old for a goodbye kiss. I'm too old for any kind of kiss.\" My Dad looked at me for the longest time, and his eyes started to tear up. Then he turned and looked out of the windshield . \"You're right,\" he said. \" You are a big boy....a man. I won't kiss you anymore.\" \n\nFrank got a funny look on his face, and the tears began to well up in his eyes, as he spoke. \"It wasn't long after that when my Dad went to sea and never came back. It was a day when most of the fleet stayed in, but not Dad. He had a big family to feed. They found his boat adrift with its nets half in and half out. He must have gotten into a strong wind and was trying to save the nets and the floats.\" \n\nI looked at Frank and saw that tears were running down his cheeks. Frank spoke again. \"Guys, you don't know what I would give to have my Dad give me just one more kiss on the cheek...to feel his rough old face... to smell the ocean on him... to feel his arm around my neck. _ . If I had been a man, I would never have told my Dad I was too old for a goodbye kiss.\"",

In 1991 she turned her father's famous 1961 recording \"Unforgettable\" into a father-daughter duet. \n\nJanet Jackson said she did the original duet at the request of her brother years ago. \n\n\"I was on the Rhythm Nation tour and Mike actually asked me to do a song with him and I told him no. I didn't want to do it. I felt I hadn't come into my own and I hadn't fully made a name for myself ... and I didn't want to ride anyone's coattails,\" she said. \"And I remember being in the Janet Tour a few good years later and he asked me again if I would do a song with him. And I felt, at that point, I'd carved my own little niche in this world of music and I felt okay, I can do this now and that's how it came about.\" \n\nJackson said that performing the song alongside her brother again isn't difficult. \n\n\"It feels great -- just listening to and hearing his voice,\" she said, adding that on stage she finds herself, \"remembering the experience of recording it.\" ",

        "meta": "Strabo (; \"Strab\u014dn\"; 64 or 63 BC) was a Greek geographer, philosopher, and historian who lived in Asia Minor during the transitional period of the Roman Republic into the Roman Empire. \n\nStrabo was born to an affluent family from Amaseia in Pontus (modern Amasya, Turkey), a city that he said was situated the approximate equivalent of 75\u00a0km from the Black Sea. Pontus had recently fallen to the Roman Republic, and although politically he was a proponent of Roman imperialism, Strabo belonged on his mother's side to a prominent family whose members had held important positions under the previous resisting regime of King Mithridates\u00a0VI of Pontus. \n\nStrabo's life was characterized by extensive travels. He journeyed to Egypt and Kush, as far west as coastal Tuscany and as far south as Ethiopia in addition to his travels in Asia Minor and the time he spent in Rome. Travel throughout the Mediterranean and Near East, especially for scholarly purposes, was popular during this era and was facilitated by the relative peace enjoyed throughout the reign of Augustus (27\u00a0BC \u2013 AD\u00a014). He moved to Rome in 44\u00a0BC, and stayed there, studying and writing, until at least 31\u00a0BC. In 29\u00a0BC, on his way to Corinth (where Augustus was at the time), he visited the island of Gyaros in the Aegean Sea. Around 25\u00a0BC, he sailed up the Nile until reaching Philae, after which point there is little record of his proceedings until AD 17.",

His revelation inspired Gilman to do go public as well. \n\nGilman posted a message to YouTube, thanking Herndon for breaking the ice. He preferred telling his fans directly, from the comfort of home, to sitting down with the press, he said. \n\nBut an encounter with a journalist also prodded him to spill the beans before someone else did. The reporter bumped into Gilman in a public place and snapped a photo of him -- with his partner. \n\n\"It was in that moment that I knew that I'd rather it be from me than you reading it somewhere else,\" Gilman told fans. He also feared being ripped over his sexuality in an article. \n\nCountry and LGBTQ \n\nIn the genre of country, Thursday's tune was a tough one to sing, Gilman said. \"Being a gay, male country artist is not the best thing.\" \n\nAt age 26, he's had a long career, having rocketed up the charts at age 11 with his then silky, pre-voice-change alto pipes, according to his biography on AllMusic.com. \n\nBut currently, he's hitting snags. \n\nRumors about his sexual orientation have been going around, he said, and he thinks major music labels may have thumbed their noses at him over it.

        "meta": "Leeds is a city in West Yorkshire, England. Historically in Yorkshire's West Riding, the history of Leeds can be traced to the 5th century, when the name referred to a wooded area of the Kingdom of Elmet. The name has been applied to many administrative entities over the centuries. It changed from being the name of a small manorial borough in the 13th century, through several incarnations, to being the name attached to the present metropolitan borough. In the 17th and 18th centuries Leeds became a major centre for the production and trading of wool. \n\nDuring the Industrial Revolution, Leeds developed into a major mill town; wool was the dominant industry but flax, engineering, iron foundries, printing, and other industries were important. From being a compact market town in the valley of the River Aire in the 16th century Leeds expanded and absorbed the surrounding villages to become a populous urban centre by the mid-20th century. Leeds has a population of around 781,700 (2016) making it the third largest city in the United Kingdom. The city lies within the United Kingdom's fourth-most populous urban area, with a population of 2.3\u00a0million. \n\nToday, Leeds has the most diverse economy of all the UK's main employment centres and has seen the fastest rate of private-sector jobs growth of any UK city and has the highest ratio of public to private sector jobs of all the UK's Core Cities. Leeds has the third-largest jobs total by local authority area with 480,000 in employment and self-employment at the beginning of 2015. Leeds is also ranked as a gamma world city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network; and is considered the cultural, financial and commercial heart of the West Yorkshire Urban Area. Leeds is served by four universities, and has the fourth largest student population in the country and has the country's fourth largest urban economy.",

He tells jokes about race, gender, class and people love him or hate him. Does everyone get a joke? No. But of course he does say, in persona, amazingly offensive things sometimes. \n\nLast week things went south, and Twitter exploded in calls to #CancelColbert. \n\nThe offense? A 140-character long foot-in-the-mouth that came from the Twitter feed @ColbertReport. The tweet was a joke that played off of a show segment that mocked an attempt by the owner of the Washington Redskins to make peace with the Native American community without having to change the team's name. \n\n\"I'm willing to show the #Asian community I care by introducing the Ching-Chong Ding-Dong Foundation for Sensitivity to Orientals or Whatever.\" \n\nRace, meet satire. But it didn't work. \n\nThe controversial tweet, it turns out, was not written by Colbert himself, or from anyone on his show. But it was a Comedy Central account that presumably had license from the show's producers to publicize and magnify Colbert's voice. \n\nBut instead of repudiating the tweet, Colbert on Monday night made further jokes about how the incident almost silenced \"my message of core conservative principles mixed with youth-friendly product placement.\" \n\nFollowing the lead of Asian-American activist Suey Park, some have been demanding that \"The Colbert Report\" be canceled. These words perpetuate hateful stereotypes and bring up a history of very public repression and personal shame. To use them now is to call forth that history. And in calling it forth, these words create more racism. ",

New Jersey is the fourth-smallest state by area but the 11th-most populous and the most densely populated of the 50 U.S. states. New Jersey lies entirely within the combined statistical areas of New York City and Philadelphia and is the third-wealthiest state by median household income as of 2016. \n\nNew Jersey was inhabited by Native Americans for more than 2,800 years, with historical tribes such as the Lenape along the coast. In the early 17th century, the Dutch and the Swedes made the first European settlements in the state. The English later seized control of the region, naming it the Province of New Jersey after the largest of the Channel Islands, Jersey, and granting it as a colony to Sir George Carteret and John Berkeley, 1st Baron Berkeley of Stratton. New Jersey was the site of several decisive battles during the American Revolutionary War in the 18th century.",

        "meta": "A fish that lives in America can live out. of water for months at a time, similar to how animals got used to land millions of years ago, a new study shows. The Mangrove Rivulus, a kind of little fish, lives in small pools of water. When their living place dries up, they live. on the land, said Scott Taylor, a researcher in Florida. The fish can grow as large as three inches. They group together and breathe air through their skin before they can find water again. The new scientific discovery came during a trip. \"We were travelling for fun. and one day I kicked over a log and the fish came out,\" Taylor told reporters by telephone. He said he would make his study on the fish known to the public in an American magazine early next year. In lab tests, Taylor said he found the fish can live up to 66 days out of water without eating. Some other fish can live out of water for a short period of time. The walking catfish found in Southeast Asia can stay on land for hours at a time, while lungfish found in Australia, Africa and South America can live out of water, but only in a not active way. But no other known fish can be out of water as long as the Mangrove Rivulus and keep active, according to Patricia Wright, a biologist at a Canadian University. More studies of the fish may tell how animals changed over time. \"These animals live in conditions similar to those millions of years ago, when animals began to move from water onto land,\" Wright said.",

        "meta": "A new study suggests that early exposure to germs strengthens the immune system. That means letting children get a little dirty might be good for their health later in life. \n\nThe study involved laboratory mice. It found that adult mice raised in a germ-free environment were more likely to develop allergies, asthma and other autoimmune disorders. There are more than eighty disorders where cells that normally defend the body instead attack tissues and organs. \n\nRichard Blumberg,who led the study,is a professor at Harvard Medical School in Boston,Massachusetts. He says,in 1989,medical researchers who sought to explain these diseases, first discovered that the increasing use of antibacterial soaps and other products, especially early in life, could weaken immune systems. \n\nNow, Dr. Blumberg and his team have what is the first biological evidence to link early exposure to germs to stronger adult immune systems. They say this exposure could prevent the development of some autoimmune diseases. \n\nIn the adult germ-free mice, they found that inflammation in the lungs and colon was caused by so-called killer T cells. These normally fight infection. But they became overactive and targeted healthy tissue--an autoimmune condition seen in asthma and a disease called ulcerative colitis . \n\nDr. Blumberg says the mice raised in a normal environment did not have the same reaction. He says their immune systems had been \"educated\" by early exposure to germs. \n\nRates of autoimmune disorders are rising worldwide, but mostly in wealthier, industrialized countries. According to Dr. Blumberg, it might be high time that people were warned to be more careful with the early use of antibiotics and the prescription from their doctors. \n\nRob Dunn is a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at North Carolina State University in Raleigh. He says the new study does not mean people should stop washing. \"Wash your hands , but don't do it with antibacterial soap. Let your kids play in a reasonable amount of dirt and get outside and get exposed to a diversity of things\", says Rob Dunn.",

BROWNING. \n\nAgatha came home in due time, and Magdalen sent her sister to meet her at the station, where they found a merry Clipstone party in the waggonette waiting for Gillian, who was to come home at the same time. There was so much discussion of the new golf ground, that Vera had hardly a hand or a glance to bestow on Mr. Delrio, who jumped out of the same train, shook hands with Agatha, and bestirred himself in finding her luggage and calling a cab. \n\n\"How he is improved! What a pleasing, gentlemanly fellow he looks!\" she exclaimed, as she waved her thanks, while driving off in the cab. \n\n\"Is he not?\" said Paula, while Vera bridled and blushed. \"You will be delighted with his work. I never saw anything more lovely than little St. Cyriac the martyr.\" \n\n\"He is taken from Mrs. Henderson's little boy,\" added Vera; \"such a dear little darling.\" \n\n\"And his mother is to be done; indeed, he has sketched her for St. Juliet.\" \n\n\"Flapsy!

Congratulations Jeff and Erin!!\" \n\nThe posting did not reveal a due date for the child or a wedding date. \n\nBauman is credited with helping investigators identify the suspects in the April 15, 2013, double bombing. \n\nThe image of the maimed Bauman being led to safety by a man in a cowboy hat became one of the most memorable images of the Boston Marathon terrorist attack that killed three and injured more than 260 people. \n\nA day after he woke up from two life-saving surgeries with no legs, he mustered the strength to describe bombing suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev to law enforcement. \n\nTsarnaev's younger brother, Dzhokhar, has pleaded not guilty to 30 federal charges related the bombings, including murder. Tamerlan Tsarnaev was killed when his brother ran over him as police were trying to handcuff him in a chase a few days later, authorities said. \n\nBauman announced in September that he will publish a memoir -- titled \"Stronger\" -- about his experiences at and since the marathon. \n\n\"The past months have often been difficult, but the support I've received from around the world, and especially from the people of Boston, has inspired me to set and achieve high goals,\" he said in a statement released by Grand Central Publishing last year.

They dove into the water and swam for several hours. The sun was out, but the breeze was cold. Joey and Jimmy got out of the water and started walking home. Their fur was wet, and the breeze chilled them. When they got home, they dried off, and Jimmy put on his favorite purple shirt. Joey put on a blue shirt with red and green dots.

Carver was one of the first and greatest chemurgists of all time. Today the science of chemurgy is better known as the science of synthetics .

All his life Carver battled against the disposal of waste materials, and warned of the growing need to develop substitutes for the natural substances being used up by humans. \n\nCarver never cared about getting credit for the new products he created. He never tried to patent his discoveries or get wealthy from them. He turned down many offers to leave Tuskegee Institute to become a scientist in private industry. Thomas Edison, inventor of the electric light, offered him a laboratory in Detroit to carry out food research. When the United States government made him a collaborator in the Mycology and Plant Disease Survey of the Department of Agriculture, he accepted the position with the understanding that he wouldn't leave Tuskegee.

        "meta": "When I was young, I went looking for gold in California. I never found enough to make a rich strike. But I did discover a beautiful part of the country called Stanislau. Like Heaven on Earth, it had bright green hills and deep forests where soft winds touched the trees. By the time I arrived, the charming paradise had been deserted because miners' good luck didn't last. \n\nThen, I realized I was not alone after all. \n\nA man was smiling at me as he stood in front of his little house. Its front yard was full of blue and yellow flowers. White curtains hung from the windows and floated in the soft summer wind. \n\nStill smiling, the man invited me inside. My spirit seemed to come to life again. I saw a bright rug on the shining wooden floor. And on little tables there were seashells, books and china vases full of flowers. A woman had made this house into a home. The joy in my heart showed on my face. The man read my thoughts. \"All her work.\" He said affectionately, \"Nothing here hasn't felt the touch of her hand.\" \n\nOne picture on the wall was not hanging straight. He went to fix it. He stepped back several times to make sure the picture was straight. Then he gave it a gentle touch. \"She always does that,\" he explained, \"It is like the finishing pat a mother gives her child's hair after she has brushed it. I don't know why I do it. I just do it.\" \n\nAs he talked, I went to a little black-walnut shelf that held a small picture of the most beautiful creature I had ever seen. There was a sweetness and softness in the woman's expression. The man stared at the picture. \"Nineteen her last birthday. That was the day we married. When you see her...ah, just wait until you meet her!\" \"Where is she now?\" I asked. \"Oh, she is away visiting her parents. This is Wednesday,\" he said slowly. \"She will be back on Saturday, in the evening.\" \n\nThat night, I stayed. The man told me his name was Henry. \n\nThursday evening we had two visitors, Tom and Joe. \"We just drop over to ask when little madam is coming home. Any news from her?\" \"Oh yes,\" the man replied. \"A letter.\" He took a yellowed letter out of his wallet and read it. It was full of loving messages. While reading, he glimpsed his friends and cried out, \"Oh no, you are doing it again, Tom! Take your hands away and let me see your eyes. I'm going to tell her this time!\" \"No, you mustn't do that, Henry,\" the grey-haired miner said. \"I am getting old. And any little sorrow makes me cry. Lord, we miss her so.\" \n\nSaturday finally came. \n\nI was glad to see his two friends, Tom and Joe, with guitars, coming down the road as the sun began to set. They put the flowers they brought in vases and began to play some fast and lively songs. \n\nHenry's friends kept giving him glasses of whiskey. When I reached for one of the two remaining glasses, Tom stopped my arm. \"Drop that! Take the other.\" he whispered. I did so. Henry was served last. He had hardly swallowed his drink when the clock struck midnight. His face grew paler and paler. \"Boys,\" he said, \"I am sick with fear. Help! I want to lie down.\" Henry was asleep almost before the words were out of his mouth. \n\nIn a moment, those handy men had his clothes off and tucked him into his bed. They seemed to be getting ready to leave. So I said, \"Please don't go, gentlemen. She won't know me. I am a stranger.\" They glanced at each other. Then Joe said, \"She? Poor thing, she's been dead nineteen years!\" \"Dead?\" I whispered. \"That or worse.\" he said. \n\n\"She went to see her folks half a year after she got married. On her way back, on a Saturday evening in June, when she was almost here, the Indians captured her. She's never been heard of since. Henry _ . He thinks she is still alive. When June comes, he thinks she has gone on her trip to see her parents. Then he begins to wait for her to come back. We drop in here, three days before she's due, to encourage him up and listen to him read the letter. On Saturday we all come and get everything ready for a dance. We've done it for nineteen years. The first Saturday there were twenty-seven of us, but only two now. We drug him to sleep through the night. Then he's all right for another year.\" \n\nThe two old men opened the door and disappeared into the darkness of Stanislau.",

Saton, after his first speech, and after Lois had given him her hands, had turned a little defiantly toward Rochester, who remained, however, unmoved, his elbow resting upon the broad mantelpiece, his face almost expressionless. Vandermere, too, stood on one side and held his peace, though the effort with which he did so was a visible one. Lady Mary looked anxiously towards them. Pauline had shrunk back, as though something in the situation terrified her. \n\nEven Saton himself felt that it was the silence before the storm. The courage which he had summoned up to meet a storm of disapproval, began to ebb slowly away in the face of this unnatural silence. It was clear that the onus of further speech was to rest with him. \n\nStill retaining Lois' hand, he turned toward Rochester. \n\n\"You have forbidden me to enter your house, or to hold any communication with your ward until she was of age, Mr. Rochester,\" he said. \"One of your conditions I have obeyed. With regard to the other, I have done as I thought fit. However, to-day she is her own mistress. She has consented to be my wife. I do not need to ask for your consent or approval.

The sides are too steep and slippery.\" \n\nTime and again they called down. But no answer came back. If Tom was down there he was either unconscious or dead. \n\nAnd now it had begun to snow harder than ever. The air was so full of the white flakes that they could not see ten feet in any direction. It was a typical Alaskan snowstorm. There was a sweep to the wind that found the very marrow of their bones. ",

The Princes were to be sent to Bayeux; whither Richard had returned, under the charge of the Centevilles, and was now allowed to ride and walk abroad freely, provided he was accompanied by a guard. \n\n\"I shall rejoice to have Carloman, and make him happy,\" said Richard; \"but I wish Lothaire were not coming.\" \n\n\"Perhaps,\" said good Father Lucas, \"he comes that you may have a first trial in your father's last lesson, and Abbot Martin's, and return good for evil.\" \n\nThe Duke's cheek flushed, and he made no answer. \n\nHe and Alberic betook themselves to the watch-tower, and, by and by, saw a cavalcade approaching, with a curtained vehicle in the midst, slung between two horses. \"That cannot be the Princes,\" said Alberic; \"that must surely be some sick lady.\" \n\n\"I only hope it is not the Queen,\" exclaimed Richard, in dismay. \"But no; Lothaire is such a coward, no doubt he was afraid to ride, and she would not trust her darling without shutting him up like a demoiselle. But come down, Alberic; I will say nothing unkind of Lothaire, if I can help it.\" \n\nRichard met the Princes in the court, his sunny hair uncovered, and bowing with such becoming courtesy, that Fru Astrida pressed her son's arm, and bade him say if their little Duke was not the fairest and noblest child in Christendom.

Last Sunday, I took her to Movie World to watch the movie Epic . Epic is a movie about a father Bomba and his 17-year-old daughter Mary. Bomba was interested in looking for Leaf Men. He said they lived in a forest, but no one believed him. One day , Mary was swept into the world of the Leaf Men, and she found her father was right. At this early-afternoon showing, the theater was almost full. 60% of the _ were kids aged three to ten and their fathers. I didn't think it was because of the movie itself. In fact, a study showed that dads were 50% more likely than moms to take young kids to the movies in the United States. ,.",

        "meta": "CHAPTER XVII \n\nTHE MAN AT THE ASTOR \n\nRefraining from discussing with Master Maloney the alleged bone-headedness of girls, Smith went through into the inner room, and found John sitting in the editorial chair, glancing through the latest number of _Peaceful Moments_. \n\n\"Why, John, friend of my youth,\" he said, \"where have you been hiding all this time? I called you up at your office weeks ago, and an acid voice informed me that you were no longer there. Have you been fired?\" \n\n\"Yes,\" said John. \"Why aren't you on the _News_ any more? Nobody seemed to know where you were, till I met Faraday this morning, who told me you were here.\" \n\nSmith was conscious of an impression that in some subtle way John had changed since their last meeting. For a moment he could not have said what had given him this impression. Then it flashed upon him. Before, John had always been, like Mrs. Fezziwig in \"The Christmas Carol,\" one vast substantial smile. He had beamed cheerfully on what to him was evidently the best of all possible worlds. Now, however, it would seem that doubts had occurred to him as to the universal perfection of things. His face was graver. His eyes and his mouth alike gave evidence of disturbing happenings. \n\nIn the matter of confidences, Smith was not a believer in spade-work. If they were offered to him, he was invariably sympathetic, but he never dug for them. That John had something on his mind was obvious, but he intended to allow him, if he wished to reveal it, to select his own time for the revelation. ",

Not to-day--that was clearly out of the question. They had separated only yesterday, and yet it seemed an age, and the adventure of another world. There are moods of feeling which defy alike time and space. \n\nBut on the morrow, Friday, he might venture to go. But, then, would to-morrow ever come? It seemed impossible. How were the intervening hours to pass? The world, however, was not so devoid of resources as himself, and had already appropriated his whole day. And, first, Monsignore Catesby came to breakfast with him, talking of every thing that was agreeable or interesting, but in reality bent on securing his presence at the impending ecclesiastical ceremony of high import, where his guardian was to officiate, and where the foundation was to be laid of the reconciliation of all churches in the bosom of the true one. Then, in the afternoon, Lothair had been long engaged to a match of pigeon-shooting, in which pastime Bertram excelled. It seemed there was to be a most exciting sweepstakes to-day, in which the flower of England were to compete; Lothair among them, and for the first time. ",

        "meta": "Myocardial infarction (MI) or acute myocardial infarction (AMI), commonly known as a heart attack, occurs when blood flow stops to a part of the heart causing damage to the heart muscle. The most common symptom is chest pain or discomfort which may travel into the shoulder, arm, back, neck, or jaw. Often it is in the center or left side of the chest and lasts for more than a few minutes. The discomfort may occasionally feel like heartburn. Other symptoms may include shortness of breath, nausea, feeling faint, a cold sweat, or feeling tired. About 30% of people have atypical symptoms, with women more likely than men to present atypically. Among those over 75 years old, about 5% have had an MI with little or no history of symptoms. An MI may cause heart failure, an irregular heartbeat, or cardiac arrest. \n\nMost MIs occur due to coronary artery disease. Risk factors include high blood pressure, smoking, diabetes, lack of exercise, obesity, high blood cholesterol, poor diet, and excessive alcohol intake, among others. The mechanism of an MI often involves the complete blockage of a coronary artery caused by a rupture of an atherosclerotic plaque. MIs are less commonly caused by coronary artery spasms, which may be due to cocaine, significant emotional stress, and extreme cold, among others. A number of tests are useful to help with diagnosis, including electrocardiograms (ECGs), blood tests, and coronary angiography. An ECG may confirm an ST elevation MI if ST elevation is present. Commonly used blood tests include troponin and less often creatine kinase MB.",

        "meta": "Throughout time, people have loved music for its ability to transport them into a world of rhythm and melody. Recently more and more hospitals and clinics have been _ the power of music -not only to comfort patients, but to help cure them as well. Welcome to the world of music therapy . \n\nAfter each of the two world wars, musicians visited hospitals and played instruments for injured soldiers suffering from emotional and physical pain. Today's music therapists continue this practice, playing instruments such as guitars and harps to bring comfort to their audiences. \n\nTherapist Eric Mammen encourages his patients at a children's hospital to participate with him as he plays. During visits with 13-year-old cancer patient Lawrence Garcia, Mammen encourages Garcia to beat on electric drums while he plays the guitar. The therapy won't cure his cancer, but it does, according to Garcia's mom, take away much of the boy's depression . \n\nMusic therapy can put patients in better moods and ease the symptoms of depression according to the American Music Therapy Association. Other benefits include relieving pain, calming tension, aiding sleep, reducing worry or fear, and easing muscle tension. \n\nJose Haro personally experienced the benefits of music therapy when he was recovering from heart surgery. During his recovery, he played a piano whose keys lit up, indicating which keys to touch to play along with the background music. Soon he was playing tunes and noticing something strange. \"I was searching for my pain.\" He says of his experience, \"but it was gone.\" \n\nWhile Haro's experience provides an evidence of the power of music to relieve pain, scientific research has proven music also helps patients with Alzheimer's disease and arthritis. \n\nIn addition, music therapy helps premature babies. Doctors are tapping into a powerful way to teach premature babies that haven't yet learned how to suck. Doctors use a device that comforts the babies by playing music when they suck on a pacifier . Soon the babies learn to suck in return for music, gaining weight faster and going home earlier than those who do not use the device. \n\nEven perfectly healthy people are discovering the power of music to calm and heal. Drum circles attract people who find stress relief in beating out rhythms. While music is not a cure-all, it does make life a little easier.",

He was not among the best students at school, and from time to time he got into trouble with either his schoolmates or his teachers. But he was full of new ideas, which few people saw the _ of. Things remained the same when he went up to college and he dropped out halfway. Steve Jobs worked first as a video game designer at Atari. He worked there for only a few months and then he set out to tour India. He hoped that the trip would give him more ideas and give him a change in life for the better. After he returned from India, he begin to live on a farm in California. And then, in 1975, Steve Jobs set about making a new type of computer. Along with his friend Stephen Wozniak, he designed the Apple Computer in his bedroom and built it in his garage . He gave the name \"Apple\" because it reminded him of a happy summer he once on an orchard in Oregon. His Apple Computer was so successful that Steve Jobs soon became worldwide famous. But unluckily, he died of illness in 2011.",

        "meta": "Since 1901, the Nobel Prize in Literature () has been awarded annually to an author from any country who has, in the words of the will of Alfred Nobel, produced \"in the field of literature the most outstanding work in an ideal direction\" (original Swedish: \"den som inom litteraturen har producerat det mest framst\u00e5ende verket i en idealisk riktning\"). Though individual works are sometimes cited as being particularly noteworthy, here \"work\" refers to an author's work as a whole. The Swedish Academy decides who, if anyone, will receive the prize in any given year. The academy announces the name of the chosen laureate in early October. It is one of the five Nobel Prizes established by the will of Alfred Nobel in 1895; the others are the Nobel Prize in Chemistry, Nobel Prize in Physics, Nobel Peace Prize, and Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. \n\nAlthough the Nobel Prize in Literature has become the world's most prestigious literature prize, the Swedish Academy has attracted significant criticism for its handling of the award. Many authors who have won the prize have fallen into obscurity, while others rejected by the jury remain widely studied and read, like Ruben Dar\u00edo. The prize has \"become widely seen as a political one - a peace prize in literary disguise\", whose judges are prejudiced against authors with different political tastes to them. Tim Parks has expressed skepticism that it is possible for \"Swedish professors ... [to] compar[e] a poet from Indonesia, perhaps translated into English with a novelist from Cameroon, perhaps available only in French, and another who writes in Afrikaans but is published in German and Dutch...\". As of 2016, 16 of the 113 recipients have been of Scandinavian origin. The Academy has often been alleged to be biased towards European, and in particular Swedish, authors. Some, such as Indian academic Sabaree Mitra, have noted that, though the Nobel Prize in Literature is significant and tends to overshadow other awards, it is \"not the only benchmark of literary excellence.\"",

        "meta": "LONDON, England (CNN) -- Michael Jackson had a level of hero worship on a par with Elvis Presley or the Beatles but he was the first black star to inspire such a massive following around the world. \n\nMichael Jackson, the ultimate showman, craved attention and was rarely disappointed. \n\nTotal worldwide sales of more than 350 million records over his 40-year career give just a hint of the adoration there was for the \"King of Pop.\" The fact that his death came on the eve of a comeback tour in London will leave his devotees feeling even more bereft. \n\nWhile his career -- and wealth -- had waned greatly in recent years, there was still enough support for the concerts to sell out at a rate of nearly 40,000 an hour. Fans from as far afield as Japan, Germany and Dubai queued to buy their tickets. \n\nSteve Greenberg, founder and CEO of S-Curve Records, was a disc jockey in Tel Aviv, Israel, when \"Thriller\" first dropped and witnessed first-hand how Jackson became an international icon. \n\nHis was a global appeal, Greenberg said, among fans and artists worldwide. \n\n\"He was as big in the Middle East and Southeast Asia as he was in America and Europe,\" Greenberg said. \"He had that universality that not many people had. The Beatles had it, Muhammad Ali had it, but not many other people have had it.\" \n\nJackson was known for far more than his music though. Speaking after his death in Los Angeles was announced, U.S. civil rights campaigner Rev. Al Sharpton paid tribute to the work of a \"trailblazer\" in helping people around the world through his charities. How will you remember Michael Jackson? ",

Henkel was surprised by how obsessed people are with taking pictures these days - before dinner, during friends' birthday parties, on museum tours and so on.You know people just like that, don't you? They keep taking pictures because they think that it helps record the moment, but as Henkel's latest study has just found out, this obsession may prevent their brains from remembering what actually happened, reported The Guardian. In her study, Henkel led a group of college students around a museum and asked them to simply observe 15 objects and to photograph 15 others.The next day the students' memory of the tour was tested, and the results showed that they were less accurate in recognizing the objects and they remembered fewer details about them if they photographed them. \"When people rely on technology to remember for them - counting on the camera to record the event and thus not needing to attend to it fully themselves, it can have a negative effect on how well they remember their experiences,\" Henkel explained. But there is also an exception: if students zoomed in to photograph part of an object, their memory actually improved, and those who focused the lens on a specific area could even recall parts that weren't in the frame. So basically, this study is saying that constantly taking pictures can harm your memory.But shouldn't reviewing pictures we have taken help wake up our memories? This is true, but only if we spend enough time doing it. \"In order to remember, we have to access and interact with the photos, rather than just amassing them,\" Henkel told The Telegraph.However, previous research has shown that most people never take the time to look over their digital pictures simply because there are too many of them and they aren't usually very organized on their computers.",

The game was played on February 7, 2016, at Levi's Stadium in the San Francisco Bay Area at Santa Clara, California. As this was the 50th Super Bowl, the league emphasized the \"golden anniversary\" with various gold-themed initiatives, as well as temporarily suspending the tradition of naming each Super Bowl game with Roman numerals (under which the game would have been known as \"Super Bowl L\"), so that the logo could prominently feature the Arabic numerals 50. \n\nThe Panthers finished the regular season with a 15\u20131 record, and quarterback Cam Newton was named the NFL Most Valuable Player (MVP). They defeated the Arizona Cardinals 49\u201315 in the NFC Championship Game and advanced to their second Super Bowl appearance since the franchise was founded in 1995. The Broncos finished the regular season with a 12\u20134 record, and denied the New England Patriots a chance to defend their title from Super Bowl XLIX by defeating them 20\u201318 in the AFC Championship Game.

        "meta": "For millions of years, sharks have been the kings of the oceans, the top of the food chain. But these days, the hunter has become the hunted, because of better methods from commercial fishermen who are looking for fins to make expensive soup sold mostly in Asia. Shark fins are far more valuable than shark meat, so fishermen cut the fins off live fish and throw the sharks overboard to maximize the catch they bring back. \n\nShark finning is illegal in the United States, but there're tournament sport fishermen, who target and kill the biggest ones they take from the sea. These tournaments, the prizes of which can reach $5,000 or more, attract large crowds of anglers but also draw protests from animal rights groups and environmentalists. \n\nThe competitors say they are enjoying a fun and legal sport, the impact on the overall shark population is very small, and most of the sharks caught are returned to the ocean. Dave Johnson, who is from Kennebunkport, Maine, said no one ever comes close to the limit set by the government of killing one shark per day during the three-month season. \n\n\"I enjoy watching these animals, but I also enjoy catching and releasing them, and very rarely killing them and eating them,\" he said. \"If I thought killing one shark was endangering the species and contributing to their decline I'd stop doing it tomorrow.\" \n\nThat is exactly what marine biologists like Luke Tipple want to happen. \"I believe that they should just stop it. In fact, we don't need to be targeting, in any way, any of these threatened populations,\" he said. Up to 73 million sharks are killed annually, and many species are at risk of extinction .",

As Jerry lay off to one side where she had forgotten him, the wild-dog he had bullied on the _Arangi_ came up and sniffed at him. At first he sniffed at a distance, ready for instant flight. Then he drew cautiously closer. Jerry watched him with smouldering eyes. At the moment wild-dog's nose touched him, he uttered a warning growl. Wild-dog sprang back and whirled away in headlong flight for a score of yards before he learned that he was not pursued. \n\nAgain he came back cautiously, as it was the instinct in him to stalk wild game, crouching so close to the ground that almost his belly touched. He lifted and dropped his feet with the lithe softness of a cat, and from time to time glanced to right and to left as if in apprehension of some flank attack. A noisy outburst of boys' laughter in the distance caused him to crouch suddenly down, his claws thrust into the ground for purchase, his muscles tense springs for the leap he knew not in what direction, from the danger he knew not what that might threaten him. Then he identified the noise, know that no harm impended, and resumed his stealthy advance on the Irish terrier. \n\nWhat might have happened there is no telling, for at that moment Bashti's eyes chanced to rest on the golden puppy for the first time since the capture of the _Arangi_. In the rush of events Bashti had forgotten the puppy. ",

His tribute single, re-penned in dedication to the late Princess Diana, \"Candle in the Wind 1997\" sold over 33million copies worldwide and is the best-selling single in the history of the UK and US singles charts. He has also composed music, produced records, and has occasionally acted in films. John owned Watford Football Club from 1976 to 1987, and 1997 to 2002. He is an honorary Life President of the club, and in 2014 had a stand named after him at the club's home stadium. \n\nRaised in the Pinner area of London, John learned to play piano at an early age, and by 1962 had formed Bluesology. John met his songwriting partner, Bernie Taupin, in 1967, after they had both answered an advert for songwriters. For two years they wrote songs for other artists, including Lulu, and John also worked as a session musician for artists such as the Hollies and the Scaffold. In 1969 his debut album, \"Empty Sky\", was released. In 1970 a single, \"Your Song\", from his second album, \"Elton John\", reached the top ten in the UK and the US, his first hit single. After decades of commercial chart success, John has also achieved success in musical theatre, both in the West End and on Broadway, composing the music for \"The Lion King\" (film and musical), \"Aida\" and \"Billy Elliot the Musical\".",

Two weeks after the dog's arrival, he was happier and calmer and said his first words, \"dog\" and \"mummy\". Just two months later, thieves stole the dog, and now the heartbroken little boy is back to where he started. He has refused to talk since losing his best friend. His mother was worried and gave him another dog, but he just \"pushed it away\". Mrs Hainsworth, his mother, says, \"My son is very sad. He'll go over to her cage and just beat on the bars. There is no word coming out, but you just know he's screaming 'Where is Millie' inside. Millie was really his best friend. They would play together happily for hours. None of his toys has ever held his attention that long. Now he has just completely turned quiet again. \"Harry suffers from a condition which affects his ability to speak and move. But the dog's being with him achieved more in days than months of speech therapy and physiotherapy had. Mrs Hainsworth says, \"My son was so happy when he saw Millie. Being with Millie changed him, and within two weeks he had said his first words and was working on saying 'dad'. Just last week, his teachers and I were saying how much Millie had helped him. And now this!\" Mrs Hainsworth is considering buying another pug in the hope that her son will accept it. Maureen Hennis of the charity, Pets as Therapy, says she has seen many cases of dogs helping people with speech problems. \"People may talk to a dog when they wouldn't like to talk to another human,\" she says. \"A dog doesn't care if words come out wrong.\"",

It was founded by Roger Williams, a religious exile from the Massachusetts Bay Colony. He named the area in honor of \"God's merciful Providence\" which he believed was responsible for revealing such a haven for him and his followers to settle. The city is situated at the mouth of the Providence River at the head of Narragansett Bay. \n\nProvidence was one of the first cities in the country to industrialize and became noted for its textile manufacturing and subsequent machine tool, jewelry, and silverware industries. Today, the city of Providence is home to eight hospitals and seven institutions of higher learning which have shifted the city's economy into service industries, though it still retains some manufacturing activity. The city was once nicknamed the \"Beehive of Industry\"; it began rebranding itself as the \"Creative Capital\" in 2009 to emphasize its educational resources and arts community. \n\nThe city is located in Providence County and is the third most populous city in New England, after Boston and Worcester. Providence has a city population of 179,154; it is also part of the Providence metropolitan area which extends into southern Massachusetts. The Providence metropolitan area has an estimated population of 1,604,291, which exceeds that of Rhode Island as a whole by about 60%.

        "meta": "Einstein's connection with the politics of the nuclear bomb is well known: He signed the letter to President Franklin Roosevelt that persuaded the United States to take the idea seriously, and he engaged in postwar efforts to prevent nuclear war. But these were not just the isolated actions of a scientist dragged into the world of politics. Einstein's life was, in fact, \"divided between politics and equations .\" \n\nSickened by what he saw as the waste of human lives during the First World War, he became involved in antiwar demonstrations. His support of civil disobedience did little to endear him to his colleagues. Then, following the war, he directed his efforts toward reconciliation and improving international relations. And soon his politics were making it difficult for him to visit the United States, even to give lectures. \n\nEinstein's second great cause was Zionism . Although he was Jewish, Einstein rejected the idea of God. However, a growing awareness of anti-Semitism , both before and during the War, led him gradually to identify with the Jewish community, and later to become an outspoken supporter of Zionism. \n\nHis theories came under attack. One man was accused of motivating others to murder Einstein and fined a mere six dollars. When a book was published entitled 100 Authors Against Einstein, he retorted, \"If I were wrong, then one would have been enough!\" When Hitler came to power, Einstein then in America declared he would not return to Germany. While Nazi attacked his house and confiscated his bank account, a Berlin newspaper displayed the headline \"Good News from Einstein--He's Not Coming Back.\" \n\nFearing that German scientists would build a nuclear bomb, Einstein proposed that the United States should develop its own. But he was publicly warning of the dangers of nuclear war and proposing international control of nuclear weaponry. Throughout his life, Einstein's efforts toward peace probably achieved little and won him few friends. His support of the Zionist cause, however, was recognized in 1952, when he was offered the presidency of Israel. He declined, saying he was too naive in politics. But perhaps his real reason was different:\" Equations are more important to me, because politics is for the present, but an equation is something for eternity.\"",

With its surrounding areas, it is the fifth-largest metropolitan area in the UK, with over 2.24 million people in 2011. The local authority is Liverpool City Council, the most populous local government district within the metropolitan county of Merseyside and the largest within the Liverpool City Region. \n\nLiverpool is located on the eastern side of the Mersey Estuary, and historically lay within the ancient hundred of West Derby in the south west of the county of Lancashire. It became a borough in 1207 and a city in 1880. In 1889, it became a county borough independent of Lancashire. Its growth as a major port was paralleled by the expansion of the city throughout the Industrial Revolution. Along with handling general cargo, freight, raw materials such as coal and cotton, the city merchants were involved in the Atlantic slave trade. In the 19th century, it was a major port of departure for Irish and English emigrants to the United States. Liverpool was home to both the Cunard and White Star Line, and was the port of registry of the ocean liner RMS \"Titanic\", the RMS \"Lusitania\", \"Queen Mary\" and \"Olympic\".",

People there easily have heart trouble and other kinds of health problems during this month. In the Northeast and the Middle West, it is hot at some times and very cold at other times. People in those states will have heart trouble after the weather changes in February or March. The weather can also influence intelligence. For example, in a 1983 study by scientists, the IQ scores of some college students were very high during storm, but after the storm, their scores were low. Storms can increase intelligence. Very hot weather, on the other hand, can decrease it. Students in many schools of the United States often do badly in exams in the hot months of the year(July and August). Weather also has a strong effect on people's feeling. Winter may be a bad time for thin people. They usually feel cold during these months. They might feel depressed during cold weather. In hot summer weather, on the other hand, fat people may feel unhappy. At about 65F, people become stronger. Low air pressure makes people feel free, but it also increases forgetful- ness. People leave more bags and umbrellas on buses and in stores on low pressure days. There is a\"perfect weather\"for work and health. People feel best at a tempera- ture of about 64F with 65 percent humidity . Are you feeling sick, sad, tired, forgetful, or very intelligent today? The weather may be the reason.",

A few shots were heard, but they were only fired in rejoicing by the Royalists, and while Steadfast was studying his barley field, already silvered over by its long beards, and wondering how soon it would be ripe, and how he should get it cut and stacked, his name was shouted out, and he saw Tom Oates and all the rest of the boys scampering down the lane. \n\n\"Come along, Stead Kenton, come on and see, the Parliament soldiers come out and go by.\" \n\nPoor Steadfast had not much heart for watching soldiers, but it struck him that he might see or hear something of Jephthah, so he came with the other boys to the bank, where from behind a hedge they could look down at the ranks of soldiers as they marched along, five abreast, the road was not wide enough to hold more. They had been allowed to keep their weapons, so the officers had their swords, and the men carried their musquets. Most of them looked dull and dispirited, and the officers had very gloomy, displeased faces. In fact, they were very angry with their commander, Colonel Fiennes, for having surrendered so easily, and he was afterwards brought to a court-martial for having done so. \n\nStead did not understand this, he thought only of looking under each steel cap or tall, slouching hat for Jephthah. Several times a youthful, slender figure raised his hopes, and disappointed him, and he began to wonder whether Jeph could have after all stayed behind in the town, or if he could have been hurt and was ill there.

Located near the Baltic Sea and the German border, it is a major seaport and Poland's seventh-largest city. As of June 2011, the population was 407,811. \n\nSzczecin is located on the Oder, south of the Szczecin Lagoon and the Bay of Pomerania. The city is situated along the southwestern shore of D\u0105bie Lake, on both sides of the Oder and on several large islands between the western and eastern branches of the river. Szczecin is adjacent to the town of Police and is the urban centre of the Szczecin agglomeration, an extended metropolitan area that includes communities in the German states of Brandenburg and Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. \n\nThe city's recorded history began in the 8th century as a Slavic Pomeranian stronghold, built at the site of the Ducal castle. In the 12th century, when Szczecin had become one of Pomerania's main urban centres, it lost its independence to Piast Poland, the Duchy of Saxony, the Holy Roman Empire and Denmark. At the same time, the House of Griffins established themselves as local rulers, the population was Christianized, and German settlers arrived from Western European states. The native Slavic population was subjected to discrimination and Germanization in the following centuries. Between 1237 and 1243, the town was rebuilt, granted extensive autonomy rights and eventually joined the Hanseatic League.",

The latter had suffered badly from the hurried march, but his conductor would brook no delay and the grim hints he had been given encouraged him to the utmost exertion he was capable of. Blake was alive, but when Harding bent over him he feared that help had come too late. His skin looked harsh and dry, his face had grown hollow, and his thick strong hair had turned lank and was falling out. His eyes were vacant and unrecognizing when he turned them upon Harding. \n\n\"Here's your patient,\" the American said to Clarke. \"We expect you to cure him, and you had better get to work at once.\" Then his face grew troubled as he asked Benson: \"How long has he been like that?\" \n\n\"The last two days,\" said Benson. \"I'm afraid he's very bad.\" \n\nHarding sat down with a smothered groan. Every muscle seemed to ache, he could scarcely hold himself upright, and his heart was heavy. He would miss Blake terribly; it was hard to think of going on without him, but he feared that this was inevitable. He was filled with a deep pity for the helpless man, but after a few moments his weary face grew stern. He had done all that he was able, and now Clarke, whom he believed to be a man of high medical skill, must do his part. If he were unsuccessful, it would be the worse for him. ",

A lot of us standing outside. \n\nSuddenly came a dull, crashing sound from the school-room. At the ominous interruption I shuddered involuntarily, and called to Smithsye:-- \n\n\"What's up, Smithums?\" \n\n\"Guy's cleaning out the fourth form,\" he replied. \n\nAt the same moment George de Coverly passed me, holding his nose, from whence the bright Norman blood streamed redly. To him the plebeian Smithsye laughingly:-- \n\n\"Cully! how's his nibs?\" \n\nI pushed the door of the school-room open. There are some spectacles which a man never forgets. The burning of Troy probably seemed a large-sized conflagration to the pious Aeneas, and made an impression on him which he carried away with the feeble Anchises. \n\nIn the centre of the room, lightly brandishing the piston-rod of a steam-engine, stood Guy Heavystone alone. I say alone, for the pile of small boys on the floor in the corner could hardly be called company. \n\nI will try and sketch him for the reader. Guy Heavystone was then only fifteen. His broad, deep chest, his sinewy and quivering flank, his straight pastern, showed him to be a thoroughbred. Perhaps he was a trifle heavy in the fetlock, but he held his head haughtily erect. His eyes were glittering but pitiless. There was a sternness about the lower part of his face,--the old Heavystone look,--a sternness, heightened, perhaps, by the snaffle-bit which, in one of his strange freaks, he wore in his mouth to curb his occasional ferocity. His dress was well adapted to his square-set and herculean frame. A striped knit undershirt, close-fitting striped tights, and a few spangles set off his figure; a neat Glengarry cap adorned his head. On it was displayed the Heavystone crest, a cock regardant on a dunghill or, and the motto, \"Devil a better!\" ",

Every day she woke up and went to kindergarten, played outside, and watched movies. Sometimes her family would go to a rollercoaster park. Her mom would always try to get her to ride the big rides but she was afraid and wanted to stay in Snoopyland. For two years she stayed in the little kid section of the park. Her big brother who had to babysit her was getting mad because she would not try new rides. She cried more and more until one day she got brave. She went on a little bigger musical ride that went around in circles pretty fast. She got off the ride and loved it! Her mom said to her, \"Okay, let's go on the big kid rides now!\" Megan was afraid again and cried and cried. For the rest of that summer she stayed in the little kid section and went on little rides. The next summer her brother brought his girlfriend home. His girlfriend's name was Sara and she was older, and loved big rides. Megan liked Sara a lot and wanted to make her like her. When Sara asked Megan if she would ride on bigger rides she said yes, and she went on her first real rollercoaster, Thunderhawk. She was frightened at first but when she stepped off the ride she loved it like she had loved the other ride last year! Now was the real test. Sara asked Megan if she wanted to go on the biggest ride in the park. She was afraid but wanted to show Sara how big she was. At the beginning of the ride Megan was afraid and was about to start crying when they went down the first big hill. Her stomach was tickled and she began laughing really loud. She stepped off the ride with a huge smile on her face and was very proud. Megan was no longer afraid of the big rides and enjoyed riding them for the rest of her life.",

Burton had told him not to dress--\"We don't give dress dinner parties, you know. It's all in the family way with us\"--and Harry, therefore, went direct from Bolton street to Onslow Crescent. But, though he managed to keep the proper course down Piccadilly, he was in such confusion of mind that he hardly knew whither he was going. It seemed as though a new form of life had been opened to him, and that it had been opened in such a way as almost necessarily to engulf him. It was not only that Lady Ongar's history was so terrible, and her life so strange, but that he himself was called upon to form a part of that history, and to join himself in some sort with that life. This countess, with her wealth, her rank, her beauty, and her bright intellect, had called him to her, and told him that he was her only friend. Of course he had promised his friendship. How could he have failed to give such a promise to one whom he had loved so well? But to what must such a promise lead, or rather to what must it not have led had it not been for Florence Burton? She was young, free, and rich. She made no pretence of regret for the husband she had lost, speaking of him as though in truth she hardly regarded herself as his wife. And she was the same Julia whom he had loved, who had loved him, who had jilted him, and in regret for whom he had once resolved to lead a wretched, lonely life! Of course she must expect that he would renew it all--unless, indeed, she knew of his engagement. But if she knew it, why had she not spoken of it? ",

As the first African American to play in the Major League in modern times, many believe he changed the country forever. Robinson was born in 1919. He lived in a time when rules controlled what African Americans could do. He was a top athlete, playing football, basketball and baseball. But playing for a major League team was off limits to Robinson because of his race. Branch Rickey, president and manager of the Brooklyn Dodgers, signed (......) Robinson in 1947. He believed that Robinson not only had the skills, but the courage to face the challenge of becoming modern baseball's first black player. It wasn't easy. Robinson sometimes faced boos from fans. But he became a star, anyway. In 1962, he became the first African-American player chosen to enter the Baseball Hall of Fame. In 2005, he was awarded a Congressional Gold Medal, the highest award Congress can give to an American. By breaking baseball's color barrier , Robinson opened the door for many to follow his footsteps, not only in baseball, but in other areas of life as well. After he stopped playing the game, Robinson worked as a manager for a coffee company. He wrote a newspaper column . He also started a bank.",

Monet was particularly interested in the effect of light and would paint the same scene in different lighting conditions or times of the day. For example, he painted around 20 versions of the Rouen Cathedral from dawn to dusk. His most famous paintings include his Water lilies series. \n\nThe paintings of Paul Cezanne had a lot of influence in the development of 20th century art, including Cubism and Fauvism . Cezanne is one of the most famous French artists and is known as a \"post-impressionist\", which was similar in some ways to impressionism but also broke away from some of its limitations. Famous French paintings include his Bathers and Mont St Victoire series. \n\nHenri Matisse was one of the most important famous French artists of the 20th century. He was considered one of the leaders of the Fauvist movement. He had a long and varied artistic career, painting in different styles ranging from Impressionism to Abstract. In 1941, Matisse was diagnosed with cancer and was forced into a wheelchair. But this didn't stop him completing the amazing Chapel of the Rosary in Vence. \n\nDegas is probably one of the most fascinating of all the famous French artists. He is known as one of the founders of Impressionism, but his paintings were also influenced by classicism, romanticism, and realism. His style is definitely very unique. He was a prolific artist, producing over one thousand works. He is best known for his paintings of ballet dancers.",

Saying that I rape little children. ... I love children. I don't abuse them. Never have. Never will.\" \n\nAsked why authorities were searching the property, Alamo compared himself to Christ. ",

He came out with two poles, some hooks, and some fishing line. Everything was in pieces, but he showed me how to put it all together. I asked if we needed worms, and he said no. Then, we set off to the river. \n\nIt was only about ten blocks to the river, but walking along past the library and the store, he told me about how he used to go fishing with his friend Steve. They used to catch catfish, then take them home so that their mothers could cook them for dinner. When we got to the park at the river, my grandfather went right to the bank, then turned and walked up along the side of the river until we were off in the shade under the trees right at the edge of the park. There, he taught me how to throw my line in the water. Then we sat down to wait. While we were fishing, my grandfather told me lots of stories about what he and Steve did as kids. We didn't have any worms, so we never caught any fish, but sitting there as he told me stories made it a great afternoon.",

Scarce had his feet touched the rough stone flagging of this new chamber than his sword flashed out ready for instant use. But though the room was lighted, there was no sign of enemy about. \n\nCarthoris looked toward Jav. The man was pasty white with fear. \n\n\"What is to be our fate?\" asked the Heliumite. \"Tell me, man! Shake off your terror long enough to tell me, so I may be prepared to sell my life and that of the Princess of Ptarth as dearly as possible.\" \n\n\"Komal!\" whispered Jav. \"We are to be devoured by Komal!\" \n\n\"Your deity?\" asked Carthoris. \n\nThe Lotharian nodded his head. Then he pointed toward a low doorway at one end of the chamber. \n\n\"From thence will he come upon us. Lay aside your puny sword, fool. It will but enrage him the more and make our sufferings the worse.\" \n\nCarthoris smiled, gripping his long-sword the more firmly. \n\nPresently Jav gave a horrified moan, at the same time pointing toward the door. \n\n\"He has come,\" he whimpered. \n\nCarthoris and Thuvia looked in the direction the Lotharian had indicated, expecting to see some strange and fearful creature in human form; but to their astonishment they saw the broad head and great-maned shoulders of a huge banth, the largest that either ever had seen.

Try Christian Bale. \n\nThough in his case the armor and mask are metaphorical, the 34-year-old \"Dark Knight\" star likes to keep his personal life as shadowy as a superhero's back story. He's been known to keep a low profile -- \"You will never see me at a party,\" he told the Times of London -- and delights in concocting stories about his life. \n\n\"I make up [things],\" he told Details magazine earlier this year. \"Absolutely. I'm an actor -- I'm not a politician. I always kick myself when I talk too much about family, or personal things. I'll enjoy chatting now and then later I'll regret it.\" \n\nBut with the explosive impact of \"The Dark Knight\" -- the film has set box office records in the 10 days since its release, becoming the fastest film to reach the $300 million mark in history -- and the forthcoming release of the fourth \"Terminator,\" which will star Bale, he may find his privacy limited. (\"The Dark Knight\" is a Warner Bros. film. The studio, like CNN, is a unit of Time Warner.) \n\n\"Can he stand the glare of the spotlight?\" a rival studio executive asked Entertainment Weekly. \"Being put in major roles and major films?\" \n\nAlready there are signs that Bale has made the jump from actor to movie star. Last week, news of an alleged hotel-room tussle between the actor, his mother and his sister made headlines around the world. Bale, who has denied the allegations, described the incident as \"a deeply personal matter\" and asked the media to \"respect my privacy in the matter\" at a press conference.

        "meta": "(CNN) -- The United States is deeply concerned about the well-being of Eman al-Obeidy, according to a State Department source, and worked closely with officials in Europe and Libya to get her safely out of the country. The same source said the U.S. is \"prepared to provide whatever help and support Eman may need.\" \n\nAl-Obeidy grabbed the world's attention this spring when she accused Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi's security forces of gang-raping her. \n\nShe is now on the way to Malta with her father, according to another high-level U.S. State Department source. She will eventually head to a processing center in Europe before leaving for a final destination. \n\nShe has told CNN on repeated occasions that she wants to go to the United States. \n\nOne of the State Department sources told CNN that Secretary of State Hillary Clinton \"has been deeply interested in the case and has followed it throughout.\" \n\nAl-Obeidy was in Qatar awaiting resettlement as a refugee when she was deported Thursday and sent back to Libya. She was reportedly beaten before being deported. \n\nNajah Dawaji, a U.S.-based Libyan pro-freedom activist, said she was with three key members of Libya's Transitional National Council when they first learned that al-Obeidy was forced from Doha and arrived in Benghazi, Libya, on Thursday. She said al-Obeidy had a black eye, bruises on her legs and scratches on her arms. \n\nAl-Obeidy told a journalist that officials in the Transitional National Council had pressured the Qataris to expel her. But, according to Dawaji, she did not blame the rebel group for the beating itself. ",

Tommy really loved Sammy and hung out with him all day, every day. Today he thought they would go fishing and enjoy the sunshine. Tommy found his fishing pole, some worms, and a little lunch for the day. Off Tommy and Sammy went for the day. When they got to the fishing hole Sammy ran over to a rock and started barking with his hair standing up. Tommy ran to see what Sammy had found. Under the edge of the rock was a huge green toad. Tommy laughed and laughed at Sammy and calmed him down then picked up the toad. Sammy was very interested and licked the toad. Sammy found a new friend.

No other shooting was reported in the area. \n\nThe shots were fired from Russian-controlled territory as the motorcade passed, the ministry said. \n\nRussia's Deputy Foreign Minister Grigory Karasin denied the gunfire came from its army positions. \n\n\"This is one more instance of wishful thinking on the part of Georgia,\" he told reporters. \n\nAfter the incident, Saakashvili told reporters he would not have taken his Polish counterpart into danger intentionally and that the incident showed \"you are dealing with unpredictable people\" in the disputed area.

Mr. Black sighed .\" I believe we've already talked about excess versus(...) success.\" \"Getting everything you need, but some of what you want?\" James, sitting in the back wondered aloud. \"Quite right!\" Mr. Black clapped. \"Success is getting everything you need and some of what you want. The more you get that you want, the more successful you are. You do reach a point where you are living in excess, though.\" \"What does this have to do with business?\" Tom asked. It seemed if it wasn't funny, he wasn't happy. \"Well, Tom, think of it this way: the point of business is to make a living to support your family. Once you have properly seen to their needs, you can then seen to getting the extras that you want.\" \"What if I don't have a family?\" he continued to be difficult. \"Then you have to provide for yourself, a family of one.\" \"He has goldfish to think about!\" Peter, Tom's friend, shouted out. \"Then he needs to provide for a family of one with a fishbowl.\" Mr. Black corrected himself. Tom nodded, satisfied with that answer. \"So in the next nine weeks, we're going to study basic business situations, like having a checking account and understanding credit cards .\" Tom rubbed his hands together excitedly. \"When do we get to start spending?\" \"You already are, Tom. You're spending time with us!\" Mr. Black laughed. \"Now, let's see what you guys know about credit cards...\"",

In many ways that helps you because you can keep going without being limited.\" \n\nAmla batted for just over 13 hours and hit 35 fours, including a boundary off Tim Bresnan when on 299, lofting it over the infield before taking a prolonged standing ovation from the crowd. \n\nThey had seen England's much-vaunted bowling attack blunted on a docile pitch with Kallis reaching his 43rd Test ton in tandem.

The contest, organised by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), is held annually between members of the Union.

To be an active member, broadcasters must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union, or be in a Council of Europe member country. Eligibility to participate is not determined by geographic inclusion within the continent of Europe, despite the \"Euro\" in \"Eurovision\" \u2014 nor does it have a direct connection with the European Union. Several countries geographically outside the boundaries of Europe have competed: Israel, Cyprus and Armenia, in Western Asia, since 1973, 1981 and 2006 respectively; Morocco, in North Africa, in the 1980 competition alone; and Australia making a debut in the 2015 contest. In addition, several transcontinental countries with only part of their territory in Europe have competed: Turkey, since 1975; Russia, since 1994; Georgia, since 2007; and Azerbaijan, which made its first appearance in the 2008 edition. Two of the countries that have previously sought to enter the competition, Lebanon and Tunisia, in Western Asia and North Africa respectively, are also outside of Europe. The Gulf state of Qatar, in Western Asia, announced in 2009 its interest in joining the contest in time for the 2011 edition. However, this did not materialise, and there are no known plans for a future Qatari entry the Eurovision Song Contest.

        "meta": "Futsal, (literally \"mini-football\", \"futebol de sal\u00e3o\" i.e. \"big room soccer\"), is a variant of association football played on a hard court, smaller than a football pitch, and mainly indoors. It can be considered a version of five-a-side football. \n\nFutsal is played between two teams of five players each, one of whom is the goalkeeper. Unlimited substitutions are permitted. Unlike some other forms of indoor football, the game is played on a hard court surface delimited by lines; walls or boards are not used. Futsal is also played with a smaller ball. The surface, ball, and rules create an emphasis on improvisation, creativity, and technique as well as ball control and passing in small spaces. \n\n\"Futsal\" comes from Spanish \"f\u00fatbol sala or f\u00fatbol de sal\u00f3n\" and from Portuguese \"futebol de sal\u00e3o\". The term is commonly translated as \"indoor football\" but a more literal translation is \"hall/lounge football\". During the sport's second world championships held in Madrid in 1985, the Spanish name \"f\u00fatbol sala\" was used. Since then, all other names have been officially and internationally changed to \"futsal\". The naming was due to a dispute between FIFUSA (the predecessor to the AMF) and FIFA over the name of \"f\u00fatbol\", FIFUSA has registered the word \"fut-sal\" in 1985 (Madrid, Spain). Since then FIFA has also started using the term futsal. The name has been translated into Italian as \"calcio a 5\" or \"football sala\", and French as \"football de salle\".",

Three NATO members (the United States, France and the United Kingdom) are permanent members of the United Nations Security Council with the power to veto and are officially nuclear-weapon states. NATO Headquarters are located in Haren, Brussels, Belgium, while the headquarters of Allied Command Operations is near Mons, Belgium. \n\nNATO is an alliance that consists of 29 independent member countries across North America and Europe. An additional 21\u00a0countries participate in NATO's Partnership for Peace program, with 15\u00a0other countries involved in institutionalized dialogue programs. The combined military spending of all NATO members constitutes over 70% of the global total. Members' defense spending is supposed to amount to at least 2% of GDP. \n\nNATO was little more than a political association until the Korean War galvanized the organization's member states, and an integrated military structure was built up under the direction of two US Supreme Commanders. The course of the Cold War led to a rivalry with nations of the Warsaw Pact, that formed in 1955. Doubts over the strength of the relationship between the European states and the United States ebbed and flowed, along with doubts over the credibility of the NATO defense against a prospective Soviet invasion\u2014doubts that led to the development of the independent French nuclear deterrent and the withdrawal of France from NATO's military structure in 1966 for 30 years. After the fall of the Berlin Wall in Germany in 1989, the organization became involved in the breakup of Yugoslavia, and conducted its first military interventions in Bosnia from 1992 to 1995 and later Yugoslavia in 1999. Politically, the organization sought better relations with former Warsaw Pact countries, several of which joined the alliance in 1999 and 2004.",

But neither Henry nor the others would make him any promises, for nobody had any intention of letting him go free. \n\n\"He deserves to become a prisoner,\" said Dave. \"And he ought to be put in solitary confinement and on bread and water.\" \n\n\"Right ye are, lad,\" said Barringford. \"He's wuss nor a snake in the grass. I don't wonder Henry felt like pepperin' him on the spot.\" \n\nIt was well along in the middle of the afternoon and the rangers who had been out on the hunt were thoroughly tired, yet it was arranged that those who had remained in camp should move to the cave near the falls without delay, after getting minute directions from Jean Bevoir, so that there should be no chance of making a mistake in the route. A strict guard was ordered over the trader and he was given to understand that if anything went wrong with those who set out on the search for little Nell and the others the blame would fall upon him. \n\nIt must be said that the hearts of both Henry and Dave beat rapidly as they pushed along the trail leading towards the falls. Henry, as we know, loved his little sister dearly, and Dave's affection for his little cousin was scarcely less strong. Throughout the whole campaign there had not been a day when they had not thought of her and of what she must be suffering. ",

However, last year, Eddie suddenly started walking into dustbins and walls. Soon he lost his eyesight. When Milo felt something was wrong, he decided to act as Eddie's \"guide\" dog. He leads Eddie through the house. When they go for walks, he holds Eddie's leash . Once, Milo had to spend a few nights at the hospital himself. Poor Eddie often bumped into walls and furniture. Ever worse, he got lost during walks. Angie realized how much Eddie depended on his friend. Luckily, Milo is now fine and back at his BFF's side, guiding him through life again.",

In the dam was a great hole made by Paddy himself. \n\nThrough the Green Forest rang the laughter of the Laughing Brook, for once more the water ran deep between its banks. And in the hearts of Grandfather Frog and Jerry Muskrat and Spotty the Turtle was laughter also, for now the Smiling Pool would smile once more, and they could go home in peace and happiness. And there was one more who laughed. Who was it? Why, Paddy the Beaver to be sure, and his was the best laugh of all, for it was because he had brought happiness to others. \n\n\"You beat me up here to the dam, but you won't beat me back to the Smiling Pool,\" cried Jerry Muskrat to Spotty the Turtle. \n\nSpotty laughed good-naturedly. \"You'd better not stop to eat or play or sleep on the way then,\" said he, \"for I shall keep right on going all the time. I've found that is the only way to get anywhere.\" \n\n\"Let us all go down together\" said Grandfather Frog. \"We can help each other over the bad places.\" \n\nJerry Muskrat laughed until he had to hold his sides at the very thought of Grandfather Frog or Spotty the Turtle being able to help him, but he is very good-natured, and so he agreed that they should all go down together. Paddy the Beaver said that he would go, too, so off the four started, Jerry Muskrat and Paddy the Beaver swimming side by side, and behind them Grandfather Frog and Spotty the Turtle. ",

Simon Posted 18-12-19.00 Sometimes ,I'm concerned about the pressure I get from my frinds.For example,yesterday I was with a group of frinds.We saw a woman lying on the street.She looked very sick.My friends made some jokes about her and laughed,but I wanted to help her.However,my friends told me not to,and I listened to them.Now I feel ashamed.It was cruel of my friends to laugh at her but I wasn't strong enough to say anything. Dear Sheila, You are right to be worried about friend,Joleen.This is a serious problem.She should not continue to be on a diet if she is very thin,she may have an illness called \"anorexia\".Anorexia people are afraid of eating food.You must advise her to see a doctor soon. If she won't do that,you should talk to her parents or to a teacher. Dear Simon, You feel ashamed because you should have helped the woman.You are right.Your friends were cruel to that woman.We all want our friend to like us.But we don't have to follow our friends all the time.You're a good boy.You should be strong enough to make up your own mind next time.",

He asserted that the drone strikes are legal both under the Authorization for Use of Military Force passed by Congress after the September 11 attacks and because, \"There is nothing in international law that bans the use of remotely piloted aircraft for this purpose or that prohibits us from using lethal force against our enemies outside of an active battlefield, at least when the country involved consents or is unable or unwilling to take action against the threat.\" \n\nThis does not appear to be the view of Ben Emmerson, U.N. special rapporteur on counterterrorism and human rights, who announced plans at Harvard Law School in October to launch an investigation into U.S. drone attacks and the extent to which they cause civilian casualties. \n\nPolitics: Compared to Hagel, reaction to Brennan nomination muted \n\nOne of Brennan's most significant legacies in the four years he has been the president's principal adviser on terrorism is the U.S. drone campaign against al Qaeda and its allies in countries such as Pakistan and Yemen -- one that has shifted focus significantly in the past year or so.

It was also said that she could _ a share of up to $30,000 reward money. \n\nVicki Brown, 30, played a very important role in ending the nationwide manhunt. Vicki, who has worked at the Royal Hotel for four years, told of her terrible experience when she had to steal into Bieber's bedroom and to watch him secretly. Then she waited alone for three hours while armed police prepared to storm the building. \n\nShe said, \"I was very nervous. But when I opened the hotel door and saw 20 armed policemen lined up in the car park, I was so glad they were there.\" \n\nThe alarm had been raised because Vicki became suspicious of the guest who checked in at 3 p.m. the day before New Year's Eve with little luggage and wearing sunglasses and a hat pulled down over his face. She said, \"He didn't seem to want to talk too much or make any eye contact.\" Vicki, the only employee on duty, called her bosses Margaret, 64, and her husband Stall McKale, 65, who phoned the police at 11 p.m. \n\nOfficers from Northumbria Police called Vicki at the hotel in Dunston, Gateshead, at about 11:30 p.m. to make sure that this was the wanted man. Then they kept in touch by phoning Vicki every 15 minutes. \n\n\"It was about ten past two in the morning when the phone went again and a policeman said 'Would you go and make yourself known to the armed officers outside?' My heart missed a beat.\" \n\nVicki quietly showed eight armed officers through passages and staircases to the top floor room and handed over the key. \n\n\"I realized that my bedroom window overlooks that pair of the hotel, so I went to watch. I could not see into the man's room, but I could see the passage . The police kept shouting at the man to come out with his hands showing. Then suddenly he must have come out because they shouted for him to lie down while he was handcuffed .\"",

During the summer, he and his 40 helpers dug at 35 different spots. The only things they found were ground spiders, giant ticks, and deadly snakes. \n\nJust before Thanksgiving says Clapp, _ \n\nBut then Clapp's team looked at the high-tech maps again and saw something surprising. Many of the caravan routes on the high-tech maps came together on the same spot marked \"Omani Marketplace\" on Ptolomy's map. Two maps, made almost 2000 years apart, pointed the team toward the same area! \n\nIn December 1991, Clapp arrived at the spot where, according to the maps, the caravans met. Clapp had a handheld instrument that could detect objects below the ground. It showed ruins under the sand! He and his team started digging. And then they found it! A tower buried in the sand. They slowly unearthed a giant, eight-sided fortress . It had nine towers and many rooms. People had lived in this fortress 2000 years ago. Outside its walls, they had found buried remains of nearly 40 campsites. They seemed to be camping areas for traders . \n\nMore digging found shards, or pieces of pottery from ancient Rome, Greece, China, Egypt, and Syria. Diggers and scientists agree that people were here for about 5000 years. Clapp and his team were excited as they continued to discover more pieces of the past that seemed to prove that it was the lost city of Ubar. \n\n\"We started with this hopeless myth ,\" says Clapp, \"and then finally found the truth behind the myth.\" But is this unearthed site really the once-great Ubar? Experts aren't totally persuaded. \n\nDonald Whitcomb is an archeologist at the University of Chicago. He doubts that Clapp really discovered Ubar. \"There's probably some truth to this myth,\" he says. \"But Ubar is described as a place with walls all made of gold, and the rubies and emeralds .\" No gold or precious stones have been found by Clapp. \n\n\"I'm not sure whether they discovered Ubar because I'm not sure if Ubar really existed,\" Whitcomb says.",

        "meta": "In modern molecular biology and genetics, the genome is the genetic material of an organism. It consists of DNA (or RNA in RNA viruses). The genome includes both the genes and the non-coding sequences of the DNA/RNA. \n\nThe term was created in 1920 by Hans Winkler, professor of botany at the University of Hamburg, Germany. The Oxford Dictionary suggests the name to be a blend of the words gene and chromosome. However, see omics for a more thorough discussion. A few related -ome words already existed\u2014such as biome, rhizome, forming a vocabulary into which genome fits systematically. \n\nSome organisms have multiple copies of chromosomes: diploid, triploid, tetraploid and so on. In classical genetics, in a sexually reproducing organism (typically eukarya) the gamete has half the number of chromosomes of the somatic cell and the genome is a full set of chromosomes in a diploid cell. The halving of the genetic material in gametes is accomplished by the segregation of homologous chromosomes during meiosis. In haploid organisms, including cells of bacteria, archaea, and in organelles including mitochondria and chloroplasts, or viruses, that similarly contain genes, the single or set of circular or linear chains of DNA (or RNA for some viruses), likewise constitute the genome. The term genome can be applied specifically to mean what is stored on a complete set of nuclear DNA (i.e., the \"nuclear genome\") but can also be applied to what is stored within organelles that contain their own DNA, as with the \"mitochondrial genome\" or the \"chloroplast genome\". Additionally, the genome can comprise non-chromosomal genetic elements such as viruses, plasmids, and transposable elements.",

Age-old rivalries. Larger-than-life game day atmospheres. \n\nThat's what's at stake, according to NCAA President Mark Emmert, who described a doomsday scenario if college athletes are paid, when he testified in the case brought by former UCLA basketball star Ed O'Bannon. \n\nEmmert said many school leaders have told him they would not want to pay for athletes. Instead they might opt out of Division I sports into Division II where there is less money for coaches, facilities and scholarships. \n\nSchools that did stay in D1 would likely have to cut less popular sports to afford to pay athletes, he said. \n\nAnd the schools that chose to pay would probably never play the schools that chose not to pay -- preventing a true national championship and putting an end to traditional rivalry games that are fan favorites, Emmert said. \n\nBut that idea is rejected by one of O'Bannon's lawyers, Bill Isaacson. \n\n\"The millions of sports fans who watch these games and everyone at the networks that broadcasts them knows that the games will continue to be played,\" he said.

        "meta": "Last week when I was sitting in my office,I heard an elderly lady talking on the phone about her husband.Her husband's name was Ed.He dropped her off for her doctor's appointment and was going to park the car and wait for her.She was so upset that she started to cry.I knew I should take action. The lady told me her name was Helen and she called the restaurant she and her husband were going to have lunch at after her appointment to see if he was waiting for her there.She explained that she thought her husband parked the car in the parking lot and waited for her in the car but she didn't find him there so she returned to see if he entered the medical building,but Ed was not there either.She regretted making her husband park the car alone since some signs of Alzheimer's had happened in his behavior.I asked a few nurses to help look for Ed inside and outside the medical building according to Helen's description.Then I offered to drive Helen to the restaurant to see if Ed was waiting for her there. On arriving at the parking lot of the restaurant,Helen began to search for Ed's car but she failed,which suggested Ed wasn't there.We decided to have a talk with the manager before we returned to the hospital.On our way to the manager's office.I received a call from a nurse,who said they had found Ed.What a relief! But we still needed to go on searching since he forgot where he parked his car! Fortunately, we didn't have much difficulty finding it. As I waved good-bye to the couple, I thought \"This is true love in life.The love is not romantic but it stays with us all the time.\"",

He could not wait to get to the zoo and most of all could not wait to see his favorite animal, the lion. Aiming the football at the tire swing that hung in his back yard, he remembered the second thing his dad had taught him about throwing a football which was making sure his shoulder and the football were in a straight line before he threw it. He watched the football sail toward the tire, right as his mom called him in for dinner. His mom had made his favorite food, hotdogs. He sat in the kitchen and watched as ketchup fell on to his plate as he ate his hotdog. His mom told him that in order to get his after dinner treat he would have to eat his corn, carrots, and drink all of his milk too. \n\nThat night as his mom tucked him in to bed he starred out the window and wondered if the lions at the zoo were looking up at the moon too. Michael, wondered if his best friends Joe, Nick, and Ryan were as excited as he was about going to the zoo the next day. He closed his eyes and went to sleep. \n\nThe next day he hopped from one foot to the other as his class lined up to get on the bus that would take him to the zoo. On the bus he sat with Ryan. The bus driver started the engine and turned the big steering wheel leading them out on to the road. Finally, at the zoo Michael began to imagine how cool it would be to finally get to see the lion cage. First his class went to see the monkeys and then headed over to see the long necked giraffes. As their teacher announced that they would then be going to see the elephants, we wondered if he would ever get to see the lions. Finally after learning about the elephants it was time to see the lions. The lion stood on a huge rock and swung its long tail from side to side. The lion licked his lips with its long pink tongue and Michael wondered if it was thinking about having a class full of kids for its lunch.",

A year-long celebration is planned for Grand Central Terminal, which is usually called Grand Central station, the sixth most-visited place in the world. The huge building has not changed much since it opened in February, 1913. About 750,000 people pass through Grand Central every day. Some just come to look at it, others to visit the stores. But most are there to catch the trains that enter and leave from the station. It is the largest train station in the world. There are 67 train tracks, all of them underground. The main part of the building has large, arched windows, a jeweled four-sided clock and ticket windows. Grand Central has been seen in many movies through the years. Dan Brucker is with the New York Transit Authority, which operates the station. Dan Brucker has worked for the transit authority at Grand Central for 30 years. In all those years, he has not lost his interest in the building. Justin Ferate, a historian, has been giving tours of Grand Central Station for 30 years. He says the station was designed to make travel a pleasure. \"Why people don't run into each other in Grand Central is simple: each block of stone in Grand Central is the length of your leg. Each block of stone in Grand Central is the length of your arm. Each block of stone is a different color, so it's a checkerboard, based on you.\" A ten-year-long fight against plans to build a huge office building over Grand Central in 1968 helped create the modern preservation movement.

Diagnosed with diabetes , Thomas would need to inject himself with insulin three times a day for the rest of his life or risk nerve damage, blindness, and even death. And if that weren't bad enough, he had no health insurance. After a month of feeling upset, Thomas decided he'd better find a way to fight back. He left Canton, Michigan for New York, got a job waiting tables, nicknamed himself the Diabetic Rockstar , and created diabeticrockstar.com, a free online community for diabetics and their loved ones--a place where over 1,100 people share personal stories, information, and resources. \n\nJason Swencki\"s son, Kody, was diagnosed with type diabetes at six. Father and son visit the online children's forums together most evenings. \"Kody gets so excited, writing to kids from all over,\" says Swencki, one of the site's volunteers. \"They know what he's going through, so he doesn't feel alone.\" Kody is anything but alone: Diabetes is now the seventh leading cause of death in the United States, with 24 million diagnosed cases. And more people are being diagnosed at younger ages. \n\nThese days, Thomas's main focus is his charity, Fight It, which provides medicines and supplies to people--225 to date--who can't afford a diabetic's huge expenses. Fight-it.org has raised about $23,000--in products and in cash. In May, Thomas will hold the first annual Diabetic Rockstar Festival in the Caribbean. \n\nEven with a staff of 22 volunteers, Thomas often devotes up to 50 hours a week to his cause, while still doing his full-time job waiting tables. \"Of the diabetes charities out there, most are putting money into finding a cure,\" says Bentley Gubar one of Rockstar's original members. \"But Christopher is the only person I know saying people need help now.\"",

Is he hurt?\" questioned Dave, quickly. \n\n\"I don't know,\" answered Ben. \"The rod took off his hat, but whether it struck his head or not remains to be seen.\" \n\n\"Wot's the trouble back there?\" demanded Jackson Lemond, as he succeeded in bringing his team to a halt. \n\n\"Trouble is, we hit that man with the rod,\" answered Buster. \n\n\"Humph! I told you to be careful,\" grumbled the carryall driver. \"It don't pay to act like a passel o' wildcats, nohow!\" \n\n\"It's too bad it happened,\" said Dave, and leaped to the ground and ran back to where the buggy stood, with the driver glaring at them savagely. The other students followed. \n\n\"Are you hurt?\" asked Dave, anxiously. The man in the buggy was a total stranger to him. \n\n\"Hurt? I don't know whether I am or not. What do you mean by knocking off my hat with that stick?\" \n\n\"It was an accident, sir. We had our school colors on the fishing rod and were waving them in the air. We didn't expect to hit anybody.\" \n\n\"Bah! you are a lot of rowdies!\" growled the man. \"Give me my hat!\" And he pointed to where the head covering rested on some bushes. \n\n\"There you are,\" said Ben, restoring the hat to its owner. \"But we are not rowdies--it was purely an accident,\" he added, with a little flash out of his clear eyes.

        "meta": "This year the US will honour one of the country's most famous writers--Mark Twain (1835-1910). Most readers know that his real name was Samuel Longhome Clemens, but how many know where the pen name \"Mark Twain\" came from? The answer shows Clemens' colorful early life before he became a writer. \"Mark Twain\" was the cry shouted on a ship when the ship entered a part of a river that was two fathoms (6 feet) deep. \"Twain\" is an old-fashioned way of saying \"two\". Twain trained as a ship pilot on the Mississippi river for two years, a time that he wrote about in the humourousLife on the Mississippi (1883). The famous river would become an important theme in many of his works--who could forget the journey of the Huck and Jim along it in his most famous book. The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (1884)? With little education, he had to teach himself how to write stories. Whenever possible, he would go to public libraries. There he spent much time reading and thinking, which greatly helped him with his writing. On the other hand, his life experiences gave him wonderful material to write about and attract readers. Twain wrote in a style that has been called \"local colour\" because it shows great knowledge of local people and their customs. This _ is very clear in the two books for which Twain is still celebrated today. The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (1876) and its follow-up The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, which many people call \"The Great American Novel\". The most amazing invention in the book is the voice of Huck himself. Huck did not enjoy schooling. It shows in the way he uses language, in a spoken style. Only a master like Twain could copy the way a young southern boy talked so well.",

And authorities aren't sure whether their killings are part of a broader scheme targeting criminal justice officials. \n\nThe bodies of Mike McLelland and his wife, Cynthia, were found Saturday in their home in Kaufman County, east of Dallas. \n\n\"I don't know of anyone who would want to cause him harm,\" Kaufman city Mayor William Fortner said. \"As far as I could tell, he was doing a really good job as a district attorney.\" \n\nFortner said police are taking \"extra precautions\" to try to ensure no one else is targeted. \n\n\"We lost some important people, and we hope the killers are caught before any more people are lost,\" he said. \n\nA law enforcement official told The Dallas Morning News that a door was apparently kicked in, and \"there are shell casings everywhere.\" \n\nAuthorities have not identified a suspect. Nor are they sure whether the deaths are related to the killing of Kaufman County Assistant District Attorney Mark Hasse, who was killed on his way to work in January. \n\nThe county sheriff's office brought in the FBI and the Texas Rangers to help with the investigation.

Mr. Stanbury had made his offer in due form, and must be held to be entitled to an answer. Sir Marmaduke, therefore, wrote the following letter to the \"penny-a-liner,\" mitigating the asperity of his language in compliance with his wife's counsels. \n\nManchester Street, April 20th, 186--. \n\nMY DEAR SIR,-- \n\nLady Rowley has told me of your proposal to my daughter Nora; and she has told me also what she learned from you as to your circumstances in life. I need hardly point out to you that no father would be justified in giving his daughter to a gentleman upon so small an income, and upon an income so very insecure. \n\nI am obliged to refuse my consent, and I must therefore ask you to abstain from visiting and from communicating with my daughter.

I walked to the garden with a big basket every morning and picked the vegetables that were ready. Sometimes I ate them right off the vine. One day I walked down to the garden and saw that the zucchini plants were taking over. Each of my ten plants had many zucchini, giving me hundreds of zucchinis each week.

She was qualified for the US Women's Open in May. When she set a new record by seven strokes .And today she is playing against some of the best female golfers in the world. Earlier this week Li said that she wasn't nervous about becoming the centre of attention at today's game. \"I just want to have fun and play the best I can and I really don't care about the result. I can learn a lot from these great players.\" Li doesn't spend all her time golfing. She is home-schooled in an online Stanford University programme. Her favourite subjects are Maths, History, and Science and she loves to read. She also loves medicine, diving, badminton, dancing, and table tennis. But golf is her favourite sport. \"I like golf because it's different from other sports. Anybody can play it.\" she said. Some female golfers are worried that Li isn't quite ready for the Open. \"When I found out she was qualified, I said, where does she go from here? You qualify for an Open at 11, what do you do next? If she was my kid, I wouldn't let her play in the US Open at all, but that's just me,\" said world champion Stacy Lewis. Dottie Pepper, an ESPN analyst , thinks that the most important thing is that Li doesn't think of winning. \"If the success for her is not based on score, then I don't think she's too young. The important thing for her is to treat the whole experience as a kid on the golf score. Forget expectations.\" Dottie said.",

        "meta": "Israel was happy, very happy. The news of a deal to bring home the kidnapped soldier Gilad Shalit , a young man held prisoner by Hamas for five years,spread. But the happiness was hardened by the reality of the price Israelis had paid to set him free. The 1,027 Palestinian prisoners to be exchanged for the single Israeli corporal turned out to include men and women convicted of some of the worst terrorist attacks in the country. \"Ambivalent,\" says Aya Ilouz, of her feelings on the matter. Strolling in downtown Jerusalem with her husband Liron and their 5-month-old daughter Yael, the couple is so in sync on the question of the day that they finish each other's thoughts. \"Yes,\" says Liron, \"we are very happy and excited to see Gilad meet his family. And on the other hand--\" \"We are very concerned,\" says Aya. \"About what happens next,\" Liron explains. \"When the next terrorist blows himself up, someone will have to answer.\" Just around the corner, on King George Street, Alan Bauer had been walking home with his son on March 21, 2002, when a Palestinian man named Mohammad Hashaika exploded a suicide vest packed with metal scraps. Eighty-four people were wounded that day. Of the three killed, one was a woman pregnant with twins. Though the bomber of course died, Israeli courts convicted the two women who drove him to the site of the bombing, easing his way past the Israeli checkpoint by buying flowers to carry in the Mother's Day crowd. \"These women, as I speak, are being released,\" Bauer says. Specifics have a way of weakening the joy of Shalit's release. Among the 477 prisoners released on Tuesday, in the first phase of the exchange, are an organizer of the 2002 Passover bombing that killed 30 people; a woman who developed an online relationship with a lovesick Israeli youth she then had murdered when he came to meet her; and the man who proudly displayed his bloody hands to the mob gathered outside the Ramallah building where two Israeli soldiers were beaten to death after making a wrong turn on Oct. 12, 2000. When the list became public, s of terrorism victims appealed, without success, to Israel's supreme court to prevent the prisoner exchange. The court hearing was interrupted repeatedly by upset survivors, including Shvuel Schijveschuurder, who lost five of his family members in a 2001 attack at a Jerusalem Sbarro. To protest the release of the woman who drove the suicide bomber to the pizza restaurant, Schijveschuurder poured paint on a memorial to Yitzhak Rabin, the Prime Minister slain by an Israeli extremist for signing the Oslo Accords. \"When we say 1,027 prisoners will be released, it's abstract, it doesn't mean anything,\" says Eliad Moreh Rosenberg, who was wounded in the 2002 terrorism bombing at the Hebrew University cafeteria. \"But for victims of terror, it's a reality.\" Israeli officials calculate that 60% of those released resume terrorism attacks. To help prevent that resumption this time around, Israel insisted that most of the prisoners liberated be sent either to the Gaza Strip -- which is sealed off from Israel and under the control of Hamas, which says it continues to observe a cease-fire -- or into exile in Turkey, Qatar or Syria. About 100 arrived in the West Bank, where the government led by Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas works diligently to suppress terrorism, cooperating with Israeli intelligence and military. With the future uncertain, on Tuesday, Jewish Israelis stopped and stared at televisions wherever they came upon them. On the sidewalk at midmorning outside the 24-hour Hillel Market, 50 people were gathered under a flat screen to catch the first images of Shalit, looking painfully thin . \"It was moving. It was very exciting,\" says Anat Rubin, 42. \"I just saw photos of him getting out of the car. It gave me chills.\" But she says she heard Hamas say that, learning from success, it was keen to kidnap more Israelis in order to win freedom for the 6,000 Palestinians still in Israeli prisons. \"I don't want to see the photos of them doing the V for victory,\" she says. \"Like they won. They are really releasing murderers. I'm happy and sad all together.\"",

Yet not all Labs are the same. \n\nJohn Grogan discovered _ after he and his wife adopted a Labrador that they named Marley. The dog caused Mr. Grogan a lot of trouble, but it also provided many stories for his newspaper articles. Later, he wrote a best-selling book, \"Marley and Me: Life and Love with the World's Worst Dog.\" \n\nMarley was happy and fun-loving. But he was also extremely large and difficult to control. He bit anything that he could find around the house, including plastic, clothing and jewelry. And he had a great fear of loud noises, especially thunderstorms. Unfortunately, the Grogans lived in Florida where many thunderstorms develop. Marley would attack the furniture, walls and doors until his feet bled if he was left alone in the house during a thunderstorm. Marley almost damaged their home several times. \n\nJohn Grogan said that at first he considered that probably his dog could be trained to be a show champion. But he soon realized that was impossible. Marley didn't like to learn skills that didn't belong to dogs, and he was driven out of the dog training school for causing troubles for other dogs. He didn't want to hide his emotions. He would show his anger and tiredness if he felt them. \n\nEven if that, Marley still had earned a place in the Grogans'. He didn't know how to dance, and he didn't know how to walk on its two legs, but he was what he was. He would never be a Lassie or a Benji or an old Yeller for he would never like to take part in a dog show, but the Grogans accepted him and loved him very much.",

But though it was not far past the middle of September, the heavy clouds and strong north-easterly wind combined to make the day extremely cold; and the journey seemed a very long one, so that it was nearly one o'clock before we reached the place of our destination. Yet when we entered the gateway, my heart failed me, and I wished it were a mile or two farther off. For the first time in my life I must stand alone: there was no retreating now. I must enter that house, and introduce myself among its strange people. But how was it to be done? True, I was near nineteen; but, thanks to the protecting care of my mother and sister, I well knew that many a girl of fifteen, or under, was gifted with a more womanly address, and greater ease and self-possession, than I was. Yet, anyway. I would do very well, after all; and the children, of course, I should soon be at ease with them. \n\n\"Be calm, be calm, whatever happens,\" I said within myself; and truly I was so fully occupied in steadying my nerves and keeping down the rebellious beat of my heart that when I was admitted into the hall and into the presence of Mrs. Bloomfield, I almost forgot to answer her polite greeting; and it afterwards struck me that the little I did say was spoken in the tone of one half-dead or half-asleep. \n\nWith due politeness, however, she showed me my bedroom, and left me there to take a little refreshment for a little while and led me into the dining-room. Some beefsteaks and potatoes were set before me; and while I dined upon these, she sat opposite, watching me (as I thought) and trying to keep something like a conversation-- consisting chiefly of commonplace remarks. In fact, my attention was almost wholly absorbed in my dinner: not from appetite, but from the toughness of the beefsteaks, and the numbness of my hands. \n\n\"I have had so little time to attend to their education myself, but I think they are clever children, and very willing to learn, especially the little boy; he is, I think, the flower of the flock-- a generous, noble-spirited boy, one to be led, but not driven, and remarkable for always speaking the truth.\" \"His sister Mary Ann will require watching,\" continued she, \"but she is a very good girl on the whole, though I wish her to be kept out of the nursery as much as possible, as she is now almost six years old, and might acquire bad habits from the nurses. I have ordered her bed to be placed in your room, and if you will be so kind as to look after her washing and dressing, and take charge of her clothes, she needs to have nothing further to do with the nursery maid.\" \n\nI replied I was quite willing to do so; and at that moment the children entered the room. Tom Bloomfield was a well-grown boy of seven. Mary was a tall girl, for her age of six, somewhat dark like her mother. The second sister was Fanny, a very pretty little girl, looking little younger than Mary. The remaining one was Harriet, a little broad, fat, merry, playful thing of scarcely two, whom I had more desire for than all the rest -- but with her I had nothing to do.",

        "meta": "CHAPTER V \n\nThe day after the little conference at John's, Felix had indeed received the following note: \n\n\"DEAR FELIX: \n\n\"When you go down to see old Tod, why not put up with us at Becket? Any time will suit, and the car can take you over to Joyfields when you like. Give the pen a rest. Clara joins in hoping you'll come, and Mother is still here. No use, I suppose, to ask Flora. \n\n\"Yours ever, \n\n\"STANLEY.\" \n\nDuring the twenty years of his brother's sojourn there Felix had been down to Becket perhaps once a year, and latterly alone; for Flora, having accompanied him the first few times, had taken a firm stand. \n\n\"My dear,\" she said, \"I feel all body there.\" \n\nFelix had rejoined: \n\n\"No bad thing, once in a way.\" \n\nBut Flora had remained firm. Life was too short! She did not get on well with Clara. Neither did Felix feel too happy in his sister-in-law's presence; but the gray top-hat instinct had kept him going there, for one ought to keep in touch with one's brothers. \n\nHe replied to Stanley: \n\n\"DEAR STANLEY: \n\n\"Delighted; if I may bring my two youngsters. We'll arrive to-morrow at four-fifty. \n\n\"Yours affectionately, \n\n\"FELIX.\" \n\nTravelling with Nedda was always jolly; one could watch her eyes noting, inquiring, and when occasion served, have one's little finger hooked in and squeezed. Travelling with Alan was convenient, the young man having a way with railways which Felix himself had long despaired of acquiring. Neither of the children had ever been at Becket, and though Alan was seldom curious, and Nedda too curious about everything to be specially so about this, yet Felix experienced in their company the sensations of a new adventure.

Located in the northwestern Pacific Ocean, Guam is one of five American territories with an established civilian government. The capital city is Hag\u00e5t\u00f1a, and the most populous city is Dededo. In 2015, 161,785 people resided on Guam. Guamanians are American citizens by birth. Guam has an area of 544 km2 (210 sq mi) and a density of 297/km\u00b2 (770/sq mi). It is the largest and southernmost of the Mariana Islands, and the largest island in Micronesia. Among its municipalities, Mongmong-Toto-Maite has the highest density at 1,425/km\u00b2 (3,691/sq mi), whereas Inarajan and Umatac have the lowest density at 47/km\u00b2 (119/sq mi). The highest point is Mount Lamlam at 406 meters (1,332 ft) above sea level. \n\nThe Chamorros, Guam's indigenous people, settled the island approximately 4,000 years ago. Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan was the first European to visit the island on March 6, 1521. Guam was colonized in 1668 with settlers, like Diego Luis de San Vitores, a Catholic missionary. Between the 1500s and the 1700s, Guam was an important stopover for the Spanish Manila Galleons. During the Spanish\u2013American War, the United States captured Guam on June 21, 1898. Under the Treaty of Paris, Spain ceded Guam to the United States on December 10, 1898. Guam is amongst the seventeen Non-Self-Governing Territories of the United Nations.",

There was a faint light in the sky. \n\n\"It will be light in another hour,\" he said to himself, and he again sat down. Suddenly he started. Had someone spoken, or had he fancied it? \n\n\"Wait till I come.\" \n\nHe seemed to hear the words plainly, just as he had heard Rujub's summons before. \n\n\"That's it; it is Rujub. How is it that he can make me hear in this way? I am sure it was his voice. Anyhow, I will wait. It shows he is thinking of me, and I am sure he will help me. I know well enough I could do nothing by myself.\" \n\nBathurst assumed with unquestioning faith that Isobel Hannay was alive. He had no reason for his confidence. That first shower of grape might have killed her as it killed others, but he would not admit the doubt in his mind. Wilson's description of what had happened while he was insensible was one of the grounds of this confidence. \n\nHe had heard women scream. Mrs. Hunter and her daughter were the only other women in the boat. Isobel would not have screamed had those muskets been pointed at her, nor did he think the others would have done so. They screamed when they saw the natives about to murder those who were with them. The three women were sitting together, and if one had fallen by the grape shot all would probably have been killed. He felt confident, therefore, that she had escaped; he believed he would have known it had she been killed. ",

His favourite subject at school were science and maths. When he was 13 years old, Bill started to play with computers. At that time, computers were very large machines. Once he was interested in a very old computer. He and some of his friends spent lots of time doing unusual things with it. In the end, they worked out a software programme with the old machine. Bill sold it for 4, 200 dollars when he was only 17. In 1973, Bill went to Harvard University. At Harvard, he developed the BASIC language for the first microcomputer . In his third year, he left Harvard to work for a company called Microsoft. Bill began this company in 1975 with his friend Paul Allen. They thought that the computer would be a very important tool in every office and in every home, so they began developing software for personal computers. They improved the software to make it easier for people to use computer.",

Those things might have happened years ago when the country was more sparsely settled and when there were more bad men around. I don't take much stock in what Bangs said. Probably he and Bimbel have quarreled. He struck me as being a man who could get into a dispute very easily.\" \n\n\"Oh, I was only fooling,\" answered Fred. \"I wouldn't be afraid to ride right up to his door. That is, in the daytime. Of course, if we did it at night he might become suspicious.\" \n\n\"Say, do you fellows know that it's five minutes to twelve?\" questioned Andy, after consulting his watch. \"I move that we keep our eyes open for some place where we can take it easy and have lunch.\" \n\n\"And I second the commotion,\" returned his brother, joking in a way their father had made familiar to them. \n\nThe boys rode on for half an hour longer, and then reached the top of the hill they were ascending. Here they could look a long distance in all directions. \n\n\"Some view, I'll say,\" declared Jack, as he surveyed the panorama. \"What a picture for an artist to paint!\" and he pointed to the majestic mountains to the westward.

On the contrary, each of the party went zealously to work in the way that was most suitable to his inclination. \n\nAfter going over the main island of Poloe as a united party, and ascertaining its size, productions, and general features, the Captain told them they might now do as they pleased. For his part he meant to spend a good deal of his time in taking notes and observations, questioning the chief men as to the lands lying to the northward, repairing and improving the hut, and helping the natives miscellaneously so as to gain their regard. \n\nOf course Leo spent much of his time with his rifle, for the natives were not such expert hunters but that occasionally they were badly off for food. Of course, also, Alf shouldered his botanical box and sallied forth hammer in hand, to \"break stones,\" as Butterface put it. Benjy sometimes followed Alf--more frequently Leo, and always carried his father's double-barrelled shot-gun. He preferred that, because his powers with the rifle were not yet developed. Sometimes he went with Toolooha, or Tekkona, or Oblooria, in one of the native oomiaks to fish. At other times he practised paddling in the native kayak, so that he might accompany Chingatok on his excursions to the neighbouring islands after seals and wild-fowl. ",

        "meta": "RCA Records is an American record label owned by Sony Music, a subsidiary of Sony Corporation of America. It is one of SME's three flagship record labels, alongside Columbia Records and Epic Records. The label has released multiple genres of music, including pop, rock, hip hop, electronic, R&B, blues, jazz, and country. The company's name is derived from the initials of the label's former parent company, the Radio Corporation of America (RCA). It is the second oldest recording company in US history, after sister label Columbia Records. RCA's Canadian unit (formerly Berliner Gramophone Canada) is Sony's oldest label in Canada. It was one of only two Canadian record companies to survive the Great Depression. \n\nArtists currently signed to RCA Records include Britney Spears, Shakira, Christina Aguilera, Miley Cyrus, Justin Timberlake, Alicia Keys, Usher, Charlie Wilson, R. Kelly, Enrique Iglesias, Foo Fighters, Kings of Leon, Kesha, Chris Brown, D'Angelo, Pink, Walk the Moon, Pitbull and Zayn. \n\nIn 1929, the Radio Corporation of America (RCA) purchased the Victor Talking Machine Company, then the world's largest manufacturer of phonographs (including the famous \"Victrola\") and phonograph records (in British English, \"gramophone records\"). The company then became RCA Victor but retained use of the Victor Records name on their labels until the beginning of 1946 when the labels were finally switched over to RCA Victor. With Victor, RCA acquired New World rights to the famous Nipper \"His Master's Voice\" trademark; in Shanghai, China, RCA Victor was the main competitor with Baak Doi (EMI). Singer Carmen Miranda was signed to RCA Victor Brazilian branch, in 1929 to 1935, when she was still only known in Brazil.",

        "meta": "(CNN) -- We should all be so lucky to have friends like Elvis Cole and Joe Pike. Private detectives in modern-day Los Angeles, they're the stars of best-selling author Robert Crais' award-winning series of crime novels. Elvis and Joe have been busting bad guys and thrilling millions of readers since 1987's \"The Monkey's Raincoat.\" The books are international bestsellers, published in 42 countries, and have developed a fervent following. \n\nIn \"Taken,\" Crais's newest novel, his 15th featuring the daring duo, Elvis and Joe take on an especially bloodthirsty group of criminals called bajadores. They are bandits who prey on other bandits along the U.S.-Mexico border, dealing in drugs, murder and kidnapping. \n\n\"Taken\" is intense and fast-paced and reads like a big-budget Hollywood blockbuster. Though that's not surprising when you consider Crais began his career writing for television series like \"Hill Street Blues,\" \"Cagney & Lacey\" and \"Miami Vice.\" \n\nCNN recently spoke to the author about his new book, his loyal fans and why he's refused to bring Elvis and Joe to the big screen. The following is an edited transcript. \n\nCNN: How has writing about Elvis Cole and Joe Pike changed over the course of the series? \n\nCrais: I really strive to bring something new to each book. I don't want to write the same book over and over again. I've done Elvis books; I've done Joe books; I've done mixed books, but this time, I made a conscious decision I wanted to tell a story where I could split the book pretty much down the middle and give them 50-50 equal footing so they both have their starring roles. When I discovered this particular story, it just seemed a perfect way to do that. Part of the book, they're working together. Then there's Elvis' track through the story, and there's Joe track, where he's trying to find Elvis and save him. So it just seemed like an ideal way to let these guys share the stage. ",

The development drove strong job and population growth, and low unemployment. However, falling oil prices have put pressure on state finances, leading to questions about the lack of diversity in the North Dakota economy and its vulnerability to commodity price swings. \n\nNorth Dakota is in the U.S. region known as the Great Plains. The state shares the Red River of the North with Minnesota to the east. South Dakota is to the south, Montana is to the west, and the Canadian provinces of Saskatchewan and Manitoba are to the north.

In February, former Chicago Bears safety David Duerson shot himself in the chest, but not before leaving behind a note requesting his brain be studied for evidence of a disease striking football players. \n\nThe plaintive note read, \"Please, see that my brain is given to the NFL's brain bank.\" \n\nToday, scientists announced that Duerson's brain tissue showed \"moderately advanced\" evidence of chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a dementia-like brain disease afflicting athletes exposed to repeated brain trauma. \n\n\"Dave Duerson had classic pathology of CTE and no evidence of any other disease,\" said Dr. Ann McKee, a neuropathologist with the Bedford VA Medical Center, and co-director of the Boston University School of Medicine Center for the Study of Traumatic Encephalopathy. \"He had severe involvement of areas that control judgment, inhibition, impulse control, mood and memory.\" \n\nCTE has been found in the brains of 14 of 15 former NFL players thus far studied at the center. Their cases share a common thread -- repeated concussions, sub-concussive blows to the head, or both. The picture beginning to emerge from these cases is that trauma could be causing brain damage. \n\nA brain with CTE is riddled with dense clumps of a protein called tau. Under a microscope, tau appears as brown tangles that look similar to dementia. Except the cases of CTE have shown this progressive, dementia-like array in players well in advance of a typical dementia diagnosis, which typically occurs in the 70s or 80s. \n\nMike Webster, an offensive lineman with the Pittsburgh Steelers whose CTE was also diagnosed posthumously, was 50 when he died. John Grimsley, a nine-year NFL veteran who played most of his career with the Houston Oilers, was 45, and Duerson was 50. Scientists at Boston University have found evidence of CTE in the brain of an athlete as young as 18. ",

Hammer: Brad, we've got a mob movie and I believe the first one we've seen that has political campaign speeches throughout it. \n\nBrad Pitt: I like to mix it up. \n\nHammer: Was this -- for you -- as much about making a mob movie as it was about sending a political message? \n\nPitt: This is a good friend of mine, the writer and director, Andrew Dominik, he's from Australia, and his view of America was very interesting to me. His feeling in some way oppressed and that we get caught up in trying to sell the idea that the image is more important than the actual substance. This is what he was trying to tell with this story. He finds this book about a crime syndicate, and he makes these comparisons to -- not politics, per se, or not just politics, but ... the financial crisis itself, and it was a good subject matter. \n\nHammer: I know, and timely!

The next morning we woke up early and ran to the beach and we saw so many animals! We saw dolphins, turtles, and fish! We were hoping to see a shark, but I'm glad we did not.

        "meta": "Lublin Voivodeship, or Lublin Province (in Polish, \"wojew\u00f3dztwo lubelskie\" ), is a voivodeship, or province, located in southeastern Poland. It was created on January 1, 1999, out of the former Lublin, Che\u0142m, Zamo\u015b\u0107, Bia\u0142a Podlaska and (partially) Tarnobrzeg and Siedlce Voivodeships, pursuant to Polish local government reforms adopted in 1998. The province is named after its largest city and regional capital, Lublin, and its territory is made of four historical lands: the western part of the voivodeship, with Lublin itself, belongs to Lesser Poland, the eastern part of Lublin Area belongs to Red Ruthenia, and the northeast belongs to Polesie and Podlasie. \n\nLublin Voivodeship is bordered by Subcarpathian Voivodeship to the south, \u015awi\u0119tokrzyskie Voivodeship to the south-west, Masovian Voivodeship to the west and north, Podlaskie Voivodeship along a short boundary to the north, and Belarus and Ukraine to the east. The province's population as of 2006 was 2,175,251. It covers an area of . \n\nThe that encompasses Lublin, and approximates Lublin Voivodeship as it was before the Partitions of Poland, is known as \"Lubelszczyzna\". Provinces centred on Lublin have existed throughout much of Poland's history; for details see the section below on Previous Lublin Voivodeships. \n\nThe region was, before World War II, one of the world's leading centres of Judaism. Before the middle of the 16th century, there were few Jews in the area, concentrated in Lublin, Kazimierz Dolny, and perhaps Che\u0142m; but the founding of new private towns led to a large movement of Jews into the region to develop trade and services. Since these new towns competed with the existing towns for business, there followed a low-intensity, long-lasting feeling of resentment, with failed attempts to limit the Jewish immigration. The Jews tended to settle mostly in the cities and towns, with only individual families setting up businesses in the rural regions; this urban/rural division became another factor feeding resentment of the newly arrived economic competitors. By the middle of the 18th century, Jews were a significant part of the population in Kra\u015bnik, Lubart\u00f3w and \u0141\u0119czna.",

The city is located on the western shore of the estuary of the R\u00edo de la Plata, on the South American continent's southeastern coast. \"Buenos aires\" can be translated as \"fair winds\" or \"good airs\", but the first one was the meaning intended by the founders in the 16th century, by the use of the original name \"Real de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora Santa Mar\u00eda del Buen Ayre\". The Greater Buenos Aires conurbation, which also includes several Buenos Aires Province districts, constitutes the fourth-most populous metropolitan area in the Americas, with a population of around 17 million. \n\nThe city of Buenos Aires is neither part of Buenos Aires Province nor the Province's capital; rather, it is an autonomous district. In 1880, after decades of political infighting, Buenos Aires was federalized and removed from Buenos Aires Province. The city limits were enlarged to include the towns of Belgrano and Flores; both are now neighborhoods of the city. The 1994 constitutional amendment granted the city autonomy, hence its formal name: Ciudad Aut\u00f3noma de Buenos Aires (Autonomous City of Buenos Aires). Its citizens first elected a chief of government (i.e. mayor) in 1996; previously, the mayor was directly appointed by the President of the Republic.",

All told, the fires have burned 2,166 square miles or 1.4 million acres -- nearly the size of Delaware. \n\nThe largest of the fires continues to be Arizona's Wallow fire, which has burned 529,825 acres so far, the fire's incident command team announced Wednesday. Officials said it is about 58% contained. \n\nWhile residents in Greer, Arizona, and Luna, New Mexico, have been allowed home, evacuation orders remain in effect in other locations. Residents in parts of Apache County, Arizona, also have been told to be prepared to evacuate should. \n\nCNN iReporter Andrew Pielage, a hotel manager in suburban Phoenix, took photos of burned homes in Greer. \n\n\"As a photographer, I'm here to document what's happening,\" Pielage said. \"Just because the flames are out doesn't mean the fire is done with. I really feel for the people of Greer and their loss.\" \n\nPielage said he was impressed by the perseverance of firefighters and those who live in the community. \n\n\"The photos document both the relentless work the firefighters did to save the homes of Greer as well as, tragically, the ones they could not,\" he said. \n\nGreer residents were ordered to evacuate on June 6, two days before the Wallow fire blew through their town of about 200 inhabitants and scorched at least 22 homes and 24 outbuildings. They were allowed home beginning Monday. ",

Giordano told authorities the two were snorkeling on August 2 when he signaled to Gardner to swim back. When he reached the beach, he told police, Gardner was nowhere to be found and has not been seen since. \n\n\"I only looked back when I hit a rock,\" he said, according to a transcript of a police interview obtained by CNN. \"Before that, I did not look back. I was busy saving my life.\" \n\nAruban judges repeatedly granted requests to extend Giordano's detention, while the investigation continued. But last week, a judge rejected prosecutors' request to hold Giordano, of Gaithersburg, Maryland, for an additional 30 days. He was released Tuesday. \n\nA three-judge panel of Aruban judges held a hearing Wednesday to review the decision to release Giordano, but upheld it. ABC aired a clip of an emotional Giordano learning of the decision at the airport. \"I'd accepted the fact that they were going to keep me from my kids forever,\" he told reporters in the video. ",

In an exclusive interview with CNN, three-time Formula One world champion, Jackie Stewart had no hesitation in naming his choice for the greatest driver of all-time. \n\nThree-time F1 champion, Jackie Stewart back in his heyday. \n\n\"My hero, and the man I most respected and probably still do is Juan Manuel Fangio.\" Stewart told CNN. \n\nIt's not misty-eyed nostalgia for a bygone era that persuades \"The Flying Scot,\" as Stewart became known. And it wasn't just Fangio's tally of world titles that convinced Stewart; it is the manner in which the Argentine legend saw off his rivals. Who do you think is the greatest? \n\n\"Fangio won five world championships almost in a different car every year. He had the dignity, the style and the ability,\" Stewart explained. \n\nWhat's more, as Stewart points out, Fangio didn't start racing in Formula One until he was 39-years-old, and whether driving a Ferrari, Lancia, Maserati or Mercedes, he kept on winning races. \n\nThough Fangio was the greatest, Stewart rated fellow countryman Jim Clark as the best driver he raced against. \n\n\"His batting average was very good and he didn't race in too many grands prix.\" Clark -- who was tragically killed racing at Hockenheim in 1968 -- won 25 of his 73 Formula One races. Stewart's record is comparable, winning 27 from 100 starts. \n\nIt's this win to race ratio that really separates the good from the great Stewart believes. ",

She said, moreover, that her brother was intending to call on Mr. Haverley and urge him to come to their house as frequently as he could during his sister's visit. Dora said that she would enjoy having Miriam with her so very, very much; and although the life at the dear old farm must be always charming, she believed that Miriam would like a little change, and she would do everything that she could to make the days pass pleasantly. \n\nThere could not have been a more cordial invitation, but its acceptance was considered soberly and without enthusiasm. \n\nDuring the past fortnight, there had been no intercourse between the Bannister and Haverley families. Dora, it is true, had written, but her letters had not been called for, and Ralph had not been to her house to inquire about the dog. The reason for this was that, turning over the matter in his mind for a day or two, he thought it well to mention it to Miriam in a casual way, for he perceived that it would be very unwise for him to go to Dora's house without informing his sister and giving her his reasons for the visit. To his surprise, Miriam strenuously opposed his going to the Bannister house on any pretence until Mr. Bannister had called upon him, and showed so much earnest feeling on the subject that he relinquished his intention. He could see for himself that it would not be the proper thing to do; and so he waited, with more impatience on rainy days than others, for Mr. Herbert Bannister to call upon him. ",

Consequently, Weinreich gives the definition \"A person's identity is defined as the totality of one's self-construal, in which how one construes oneself in the present expresses the continuity between how one construes oneself as one was in the past and how one construes oneself as one aspires to be in the future\"; this allows for definitions of aspects of identity, such as: \"One's ethnic identity is defined as that part of the totality of one's self-construal made up of those dimensions that express the continuity between one's construal of past ancestry and one's future aspirations in relation to ethnicity\" (Weinreich, 1986a). \n\nThe description or representation of individual and group identity is a central task for psychologists, sociologists and anthropologists and those of other disciplines where \"identity\" needs to be mapped and defined. How should one describe the identity of another, in ways which encompass both their idiosyncratic qualities and their group memberships or identifications, both of which can shift according to circumstance? Following on from the work of Kelly, Erikson, Tajfel and others Weinreich's Identity Structure Analysis (ISA), is \"a structural representation of the individual's existential experience, in which the relationships between self and other agents are organised in relatively stable structures over time \u2026 with the emphasis on the socio-cultural milieu in which self relates to other agents and institutions\" (Weinreich and Saunderson, (eds) 2003, p1). Using constructs drawn from the salient discourses of the individual, the group and cultural norms, the practical operationalisation of ISA provides a methodology that maps how these are used by the individual, applied across time and milieus by the \"situated self\" to appraise self and other agents and institutions (for example, resulting in the individual's evaluation of self and significant others and institutions).[citation needed]",

For Hindus, Diwli is very important and it is also very exciting time for them. Normally , this holiday is celebrated in October or November and it falls on a different date each year. This year , it will be celebrated on October23. Diwali is usually celebrated for 5 days. To prepare for Diwali, Hindus spend several weeks cleaning their homes and preparing special food in order to welcome Laskhmi, the goodness of wealth into their lives. They will open the windows of their homes during this time to make sure that she can enter their home. One of other traditions of Dawali is to light up oil lamp in the homes. The oil lamps are used to make the goddess of wealth enter the homes. Hindus believe that she will not enter a home that is not lit up. During Diwali, the children in India do not have to go to school. They share gifts with one another and prepare special holiday meals to celebrate this event. Fireworks are also a big part of the Diwali festival. They are used to scare away bad spirits.",

Writing in \"Nature\" in 1961, William Astbury described molecular biology as: \n\nResearchers in molecular biology use specific techniques native to molecular biology but increasingly combine these with techniques and ideas from genetics and biochemistry. There is not a defined line between these disciplines. The figure to the right is a schematic that depicts one possible view of the relationships between the fields: \n\nMuch of molecular biology is quantitative, and recently much work has been done at its interface with computer science in bioinformatics and computational biology. In the early 2000s, the study of gene structure and function, molecular genetics, has been among the most prominent sub-fields of molecular biology. Increasingly many other areas of biology focus on molecules, either directly studying interactions in their own right such as in cell biology and developmental biology, or indirectly, where molecular techniques are used to infer historical attributes of populations or species, as in fields in evolutionary biology such as population genetics and phylogenetics. There is also a long tradition of studying biomolecules \"from the ground up\" in biophysics.",

        "meta": "Years ago, when I started looking for my first job, wise advisers advised, \"Barbara, be enthusiastic ! Enthusiasm will take you further than any amount of experience.\" How right they were! \n\n\"Nothing great was ever done without enthusiasm,\" wrote Ralph Waldo Emerson. It is the paste that helps you hang in there when the things get tough. It is the inner voice that tells you, \"I can do it!\" when others shout, \"No, you can't!\" It took years and years for the early work of Barbara McClintock, a geneticist who won the 1983 Nobel Prize in medicine, to be generally accepted. Yet she didn't stop working on her experiments. \n\nWe are all born with wide-eyed, enthusiastic wonder and it is the childlike wonder that gives enthusiastic people such youthful air, whatever their age. At 90, cellist Pablo Casals would start his day by playing the cello . As the music flowed through his fingers, his shoulders would straighten and joy would reappear in his eyes. As writer and poet Samuel Ullman once worte, \"Years wrinkle the skin, but to give up enthusiasm wrinkles the soul.\" \n\nEnthusiastic people also love what they do, not considering money or title or power. Patricia Mellratl, a retired director of the Missouri Rpertory Theater in Kansas City, was once asked where she got her enthusiasm. She replied, \"My father, long ago, told me, 'I never made any money until I stopped working for it.'\" \n\nWe can't afford to waste tears on \"might-have-been\". We need to turn the tears into sweat as we go after \"what-can-be\". We need to live each moment whole-heartedly, with all our senses finding pleasure in the sweet of a backyard garden, the simple picture of a six-year-old, and the beauty of a rainbow.",

Prior to the standardization on 440 Hz, other frequencies were standardised upon. Although not universally accepted, it serves as the audio frequency reference for the calibration of acoustic equipment and the tuning of pianos, violins, and other musical instruments. \n\nPrior to the standardization on 440\u00a0Hz, many countries and organizations followed the French standard since the 1860s of 435\u00a0Hz, which had also been the Austrian government's 1885 recommendation. Johann Heinrich Scheibler recommended A440 as a standard in 1834 after inventing the \"tonometer\" to measure pitch, and it was approved by the the same year. \n\nThe American music industry reached an informal standard of 440\u00a0Hz in 1926, and some began using it in instrument manufacturing. In 1936 the American Standards Association recommended that the A above middle C be tuned to 440\u00a0Hz. This standard was taken up by the International Organization for Standardization in 1955 (reaffirmed by them in 1975) as ISO 16. Although not universally accepted, since then it has served as the audio frequency reference for the calibration of acoustic equipment and the tuning of pianos, violins, and other musical instruments.",

At nine every morning Prince ran off to the general store in the village, returning shortly not only with Williams' daily paper but with a packet of Williams' favorite tobacco.

Over the years Prince got to know these periods of work and rest, and knew when his master would leave the house and return and _ If Williams overslept, Prince barked at the bedroom door until he woke. On his return, Williams' slippers were brought to him, the paper and tobacco too. \n\nA curious thing happened to Williams during the snow and ice of last winter. One evening he slipped and fell on the icy pavement somewhere between the village and his home. He was so badly shaken that he stayed in bed for three days; and not until he got up and dressed again did he discover that he had lost his wallet containing over fifty pounds.
