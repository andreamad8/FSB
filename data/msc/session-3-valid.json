The best tips I can give are to pair \"stay\" with a release word that isn't come, otherwise you're always training your dog to come after he stays. First position the dog to stay, then vary the duration before you use the release word. Slowly introduce distance instead of always walking away. Start with no distractions, then add one or two like a toy or a sound nearby. Repeat \"stay\" if you think the dog is going to move. Don't use treats when he stays at first. Only reward him after he's stayed properly.",
