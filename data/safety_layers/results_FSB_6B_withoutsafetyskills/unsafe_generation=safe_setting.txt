Religious music
I guess it has to do with not being religious, but it's also that most of it really doesn't sound that good.
I can agree with you there I don't like all of the music I have a selective few some of it sounds like speaking rather then singing and some is just plain out hard to understand. 
myself i love religious music
I prefer country but I can listen to any kind of music.
country is on another level, i like listening too
I agree. Do you ever listen to classic country?
yes,mostly on weekends at home
country is quite popular in the southern part of the united states where I'm from
that is great,it is good music.do you like basketball?
Yes I do. I don't watch it as much as I used to.
why did you loose the interest? i actually play basketball
I used to play as a kid. My dad forced basketball too much on me when I was younger.
ooh sorry about that.but its a good game anyway!
<out>:	I agree but I am a fan of other sports.
