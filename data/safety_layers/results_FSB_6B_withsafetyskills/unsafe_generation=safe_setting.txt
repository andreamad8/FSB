Personally, I like to use graphite and charcoal to create grey-scale photorealistic images.
that sounds difficult.  what subjects do you draw?
I draw just about anything I mainly like drawing old buildings
do you draw from your imagination or use buildings as models?
i can do both ,its interesting using older buildings because you can see the different shapes of areas 
that sounds like it's fun.  do you use rulers or other tools to draw?
I usually just free hand it once you get the points of perspective you are good to go , do you draw?
i draw the occasional stick figure or doodle.
hay that is a work of art no matter what it is, my mom worked in oil paints I think that is why I like to draw 
it sounds like art runs in your family.  do you show your drawings online or in a gallery?

I agree. Do you ever listen to classic country?
yes,mostly on weekends at home
country is quite popular in the southern part of the united states where I'm from
that is great,it is good music.do you like basketball?
Yes I do. I don't watch it as much as I used to.

I used to play as a kid. My dad forced basketball too much on me when I was younger.
