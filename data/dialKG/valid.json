Hi reader in the U.S., it seems you use Wikipedia a lot; that's great! It's a little awkward to ask, but this Saturday we need your help. We\u2019re not salespeople. We\u2019re librarians, archivists, and information junkies. We depend on donations averaging $16.36, but fewer than 1% of readers give. If you donate just $3, the price of your coffee this Saturday, Wikipedia could keep thriving. Thank you.    MAYBE LATER CLOSE The Man in the Iron Mask (French: L'Homme au Masque de Fer; c. 1640 \u2013 19 November 1703) is the name given to an unidentified prisoner who was arrested in 1669 or 1670 and subsequently held in a number of French prisons, including the Bastille and the Fortress of Pignerol (modern Pinerolo, Italy). He was held in the custody of the same jailer, B\u00e9nigne Dauvergne de Saint-Mars, for a period of 34 years. He died on 19 November 1703 under the name \"Marchioly\", during the reign of Louis XIV of France."
